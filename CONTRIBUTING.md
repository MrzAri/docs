# Contribute To Web Platform Docs

Web Platform Docs are only as good as our contributors make them. And anyone can be a contributor. Interested? Here's how to get involved.

## Where To Start

### Step 1: Clone the site source repository

(Instructions to be added here)


### Step 2: Make a Change.

Do you see a mistake on a page that needs to be fixed? Something that can could be written better? Information that's inaccurate or old? Well, jump in — go ahead and change the page. Really. Just fix it. We need lots of people contributing more than we need perfection.

Scared you'll make a mistake? Try our practice page. You can make mistakes there without hurting anything.


### Step 3: Join the Group Email List and Introduce Yourself.

Next, sign up for our group email. This is where everyone who's involved talks to each other. Join the list by emailing an empty message with the subject “subscribe” to [public-webplatform-request][subscribe] from the email address you'd like to use.

If you've never used a mailing list, take note of the following. Mailing lists at w3.org are handled with two addresses, one that has the word -request, that is a self-service bot, and the main mailing list. You just need to remember that the conversation happens on [public-webplatform] (i.e. without -request).

Once you are on the list, please email the group and introduce yourself. Who are you? What would you like to contribute? Are you unsure of what to work on — that's fine. Reach out to us, and we'll be happy to find something for you. Do have have a suggestion on how WPD can be better? We'd love to hear it.

You can read the archives and learn more about how the email list works [on the lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webplatform][archive] archive site.
