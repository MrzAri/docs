{{Summary_Section|PhoneGap is an application framework that enables you to build natively installed applications using HTML and JavaScript.  The easiest way to think of PhoneGap is a web view container that is 100% width and 100% height, with a JavaScript programming interface that allows you to access operating system features.}}
{{Concept_Page
|Content=PhoneGap was originally developed by Nitobi, a company acquired by Adobe in 2011. After it was acquired, Nitobi donated the PhoneGap code base to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under the project name Cordova, which is the name of the street in Vancouver where Nitobi’s offices were located and where the company created the first version of the framework.
One of biggest advantages to move the code base to the ASF is that big companies can easily contribute to the project (many companies are not only comfortable with the Apache organization and license, but already have a Contributor License Agreement [CLA] with Apache); furthermore, the project is now under an open and transparent government: its community!
PhoneGap is a free and openly licensed distribution of Apache Cordova. Picture Cordova to be the engine upon which PhoneGap and its related services (i.e. emulation and build services) are built. For existing PhoneGap developers nothing has changed; but for those who are interested in contributing to the project Apache Cordova is a great chance to join a vibrant open source community.
Adobe continues to play a major role in the project, investing in its ongoing development, and the company decided to keep the PhoneGap name to describe its own distribution of the Cordova project. Other contributors to the Apache Cordova project include Google, RIM, Microsoft, IBM, Nokia, Intel, and Hewlett-Packard.

A PhoneGap application is a “native-wrapped” web application through the web browser native widget most of the mobile development SDKs provide as a part of their UI framework (this widget is known as “web view”, following the links to get more information about the web view in iOS http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIWebView_Class/Reference/Reference.html and the one in Android  http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html).
In purely native applications, web view controls are used to display HTML content either from a remote server, or local HTML packaged along with the native application in some way. The native “wrapper” application generated by PhoneGap loads the end developer’s HTML pages into one of these web view controls, and displays the resulting HTML as the UI when the application is launched.
