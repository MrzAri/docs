# multiplication assignment

## Summary

Multiplies the value of a variable by the value of an expression and assigns the result to the variable.

## Syntax

    result *= expression

**result**
:   Any variable.

**expression**
:   Any expression.

## Examples

``` {.js}
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
y *= x; // result: y = 10
```

## Remarks

Using the **\*=** operator is exactly the same as specifying:

    result = result * expression
