# assignment

## Summary

The assignment operator takes the value of the right operand and assigns it to the left operand.

## Syntax

    result = expression;

**result**
:   Any variable.

**expression**
:   Any expression that returns a value.

## Examples

``` {.js}
var x;
x = 5;
```

## Remarks

The = operator behaves like other operators, so expressions that contain it have a value. This means that you can chain assignment operators as follows: `j = k = l = 0`. In this case `j` , `k` , and `l` equal zero.
