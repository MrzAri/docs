|Usage=
|Notes===Future reserved words==
JavaScript also has a list of future reserved words. These words are not currently part of the JavaScript language, although they are reserved for future use. For more information about future reserved keywords in JavaScript, see [[javascript/future reserved words{{!}}JavaScript Future Reserved Words]].

==Intrinsic objects or functions== 
When choosing identifiers it is also important to avoid any words that are already the names of intrinsic JavaScript objects or functions, such as '''String''' or '''parseInt'''.
