## Constants

Constant
:   Description
[E](/javascript/Math/constants)
:   The mathematical constant e. This is Euler's number, the base of natural logarithms.
[Infinity](/javascript/Infinity)
:   A value that is larger than the largest floating point number. Negative Infinity (-Infinity) is smaller than the smallest floating point number.
[LN2](/javascript/Math/constants)
:   The natural logarithm of 2.
[LN10](/javascript/Math/constants)
:   The natural logarithm of 10.
[LOG2E](/javascript/Math/constants)
:   The base-2 logarithm of e.
[LOG10E](/javascript/Math/constants)
:   The base-10 logarithm of e.
[MAX\_VALUE](/javascript/Number/constants)
:   The largest number that can be represented in JavaScript.
[MIN\_VALUE](/javascript/Number/constants)
:   The closest number to zero that can be represented in JavaScript.
[NaN](/javascript/Number/constants)
:   Indicates that an arithmetic expression returned a value that is not a number.
[NaN (Global)](/javascript/NaN)
:   A value that indicates that an expression is not a number.
[NEGATIVE\_INFINITY](/javascript/Number/constants)
:   A value that is smaller than the smallest floating point number.
[null Constant](/javascript/null)
:   The value of a variable that does not point to valid data.
[PI](/javascript/Math/constants)
:   Pi. This is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.
[POSITIVE\_INFINITY](/javascript/Number/constants)
:   A value that is larger than the largest floating point number.
[SQRT1\_2](/javascript/Math/constants)
:   The square root of 0.5, or, equivalently, one divided by the square root of 2.
[SQRT2](/javascript/Math/constants)
:   The square root of 2.
[undefined](/javascript/undefined)
:   The value of a variable that has been declared but not initialized.
