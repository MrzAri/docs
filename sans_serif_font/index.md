# sans serif font

## sans-serif font

A typeface that does not have the small projecting features (serifs) at the ends of character strokes, such as Arial. Modern convention holds that sans-serif fonts are preferred over serif fonts for online text, while serif fonts are preferred for print. Contrast with [serif font](/serif_font).
