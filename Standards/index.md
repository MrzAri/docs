==Standards Organizations==
There are various organizations that contribute to the features of the Open Web Platform. They vary in their methods and focus, and are generally referred to as '''Standards Development Organizations (SDOs)''' or '''standards bodies''' (though some people use the term ''standards body'' to refer exclusively to larger, traditional organizations that are often government-backed).
