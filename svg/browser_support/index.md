== SVG browser support ==
Eventually it would be nice to have an up-to-date overview of SVG in the latest browsers here. For now, have a look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics#Support_for_SVG_in_web_browsers wikipedia's page on the topic].

=== Hardware acceleration ===
Support for [http://hardware%20accelerated https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_acceleration] SVG can greatly boost performance.

Today's popular desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera and Safari) all support it to various degrees.

''TODO: List of mobile browsers with their levels of support.''
