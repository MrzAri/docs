Interfaces become more vibrant once you add animation effects.  This
guide focuses on SVG's built-in animation features, which derive from
SMIL, the ''Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language''.  As
discussed in the [[svg/tutorials/smarter_svg_overview|SVG grand
tour]], some SVG element attributes are actually implemented as CSS
''properties'', and thus respond to CSS
[[tutorials/css_transitions|transitions]] and
[[tutorials/css_animations|keyframe animations]]. The techniques
described here offer the only way to animate SVG ''attributes'', but
they can be used for ''properties'' as well. You'll also learn how to
dynamically modify any attribute values that can't be animated.

==A simple animation==

Start with a simple element that you'd like to animate:

<syntaxhighlight lang="xml">
<text x="0" y="100">An SVG Animation</text>
</syntaxhighlight>

Nest an [[svg/elements/animate|'''animate''']] element such as the
following:

<syntaxhighlight lang="xml">
<text x="0" y="100">
    An SVG Animation
    <animate
        attributeName = "x"
        from          = "1000"
        to            = "0"
        begin         = "0s"
        dur           = "1s"
    />
</text>
</syntaxhighlight>

When you load the SVG, the resulting animation quickly swipes in some
text from the right side of the screen:

[[Image:svga_simpleSwipe.png|400px]]

Each animation element can only modify the value of one attribute at a
time, specified by the
[[svg/attributes/attributeName|'''attributeName''']]. The
[[svg/attributes/from|'''from''']] and [[svg/attributes/to|'''to''']]
set what the values of that attribute should be at the beginning and
end of the animation.
Setting the [[svg/attributes/begin|'''begin''']] to '''0s''' makes it
execute immediately, and the [[svg/attributes/dur|'''dur''']] sets a
one-second duration for which the animation executes.

<!--

(e.g. swipe effect)

* begin = timecount (s/ms)
* dur
* from
* to

* attributeName="???"
* attributeType="xml"

==Adding a delay==

==Sequences==

(e.g. oscillating blur)

* values (abs)
* values (%)

* "values" along the way; e.g. oscillation
* "keyTimes" matches "values"

==Setting the pace==

(swipe + bounce)

* calcMode = discrete: like CSS step()
* calcMode = linear (default) between values
* calcMode = paced (linear over entire animation; ignoring intermedite values)
* calcMode = spline

* "keySplines" == CSS cubic-bezier()

==Syncronization==

* begin = id.event
* begin = id.event+timeValue
* circle-anim.repeat(1) + 2.5s
* prev.begin

==Repetition, Repetition

* begin (>1) re-fires (eyeballs)
* repeatCount = "indefinite"/###
* fill = freeze (like fill-mode)

==Building progressions==



* from/by???
* additive="sum" == relative "from" values
* accumulate="sum" == build on prior values

==Scripting animations==

* restart = whenNotActive
* begin/repeat/end events

* beginElement()
* beginElementAt(tv)

pause

==Animating properties==

* instead of via CSS?

==Specialized animation types==

* animateMotion (move along moving path?)
** rotate="auto" (default)
** rotate="auto-reverse" invert
** path="data" vs mpath

* animateColor

* animateTransform (brain)

==The 'set' shorthand==

* discrete values
