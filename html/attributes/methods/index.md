===Remarks===
When the HTTP protocol is used, these methods are  given more accurately by the protocol.  However, for reasons similar to those for the [[html/attributes/title|'''title''']] property, it can be useful to include the information in advance in the link. The HTML user agent can choose a different rendering as a function of the methods that are allowed. For example, if an object has a method that supports searching, an icon denoting this can be rendered.
