**Needs Summary**: This article does not have a summary. Summaries give a brief overview of the topic and are automatically included on some listing pages that link to this article.

Applies to
:    ?

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.

## Notes

### Remarks

This property is the opposite of [**borderColorLight**](/html/attributes/borderColorLight) and must be used with the [**border**](/html/attributes/border) property that corresponds to the **BORDER** attribute. This property does not affect the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) [**border**](/css/properties/border) composite properties. Some client applications do not recognize color names, but all client applications should recognize RGB color values and display them correctly. This property is no longer recommended. Use the [**borderColor**](/css/properties/border-color) property instead.
