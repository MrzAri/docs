{{API_Name|HTML Media Capture}}
{{Summary_Section|The capture attribute facilitates user access to a device's media capture mechanism, such as a camera, or microphone, from within a file upload control, for capturing media on the spot.}}
{{Markup_Attribute
|Applies_to=[[dom/HTMLInputElement|HTMLInputElement]]
|Property_applies_to=dom/HTMLElement
|Content=The capture attribute is a boolean attribute that, if specified, indicates that the capture of media directly from the device's environment using a media capture mechanism is preferred.

The capture attribute applies to input elements when the type attribute's value is file and its accept attribute is specified. If the accept attribute's value is set to a MIME type that has no associated capture control type, the user agent acts as if there was no capture attribute.

The media capture mechanism builds upon the security and privacy protections provided by the <input type="file"> and the File API specifications; in particular, it is expected that any offer to start capturing content from the userâ€™s device would require a specific user interaction on an HTML element that is entirely controlled by the user agent.
