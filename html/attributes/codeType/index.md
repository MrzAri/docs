## Notes

### Remarks

Internet media types are also known as MIME types. The **codeType** property is read-only for any pre-existing object in an HTML document. For instances of objects that are created in script, the **codeType** property is read/write-once, because the **codeType** property is written when an object is created. After an instance of an object is created, the **codeType** property is read-only.
