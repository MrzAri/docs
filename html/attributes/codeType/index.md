===Remarks===
Internet media types are also known as MIME types.
The '''codeType''' property is read-only for any pre-existing object in an HTML document. For instances of objects that are created in script, the '''codeType''' property is read/write-once, because the '''codeType''' property is written when an object is created. After an instance of an object is created, the '''codeType''' property is read-only.
