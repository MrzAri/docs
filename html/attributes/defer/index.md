# defer

## Summary

Sets or retrieves the status of the script.

Applies to
:   Â ?

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.

## Notes

### Remarks

Using the attribute at design time can improve the download performance of a document because the client does not need to parse and execute the script and can continue downloading and parsing the document instead.

### Issues

IE\<10 may interleave execution of scripts. [Discussion on Github.](https://github.com/h5bp/lazyweb-requests/issues/42)

Combining scrips both standard and with `defer` that depend on each other. [Discussion on Github.](https://github.com/zenorocha/browser-diet/issues/95#issuecomment-14852531)
