The HTML time element (<time>) represents either time on a 24-hour clock or a precise date in the Gregorian calendar (with optional time and timezone information).

This element is intended to be used presenting dates and times in a machine readable format. This can be helpful for user agents to offer any event scheduling for user's calendar.
