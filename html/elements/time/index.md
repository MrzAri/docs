{{Summary_Section|The <code>time</code> tag defines either a time (24 hour clock), or a date in the Gregorian calendar, optionally with a time and a time-zone offset. It does not render differently in any of the major browsers.

This element can be used as a way to encode dates and times in a machine-readable way so that, for example, user agents can offer to add birthday reminders or scheduled events to the user's calendar.
