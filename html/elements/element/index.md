|Content=Custom elements are new types of DOM elements that can be defined by authors.

Custom elements can define presentation aspects like decorators. Unlike a decorator, which can be applied or unapplied to a given element, the element's type is fixed. So custom elements can also define new state and behavior, which decorators can't do because of their ephemeral nature.
