|Description=The following example shows the difference between denoting the importance of a span of text ('''strong''') as opposed to denoting the relevance of a span of text ('''mark'''). It is an extract from a textbook, where the extract has had the parts relevant to the exam highlighted. The safety warnings, important though they may be, are not relevant to the exam.
|Code=&lt;h3&gt;Wormhole Physics Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;A wormhole in normal conditions can be held open for a
maximum of just under 39 minutes.&lt;/mark&gt; Conditions that can increase
the time include a powerful energy source coupled to one or both of
the gates connecting the wormhole, and a large gravity well (such as a
black hole).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;Momentum is preserved across the wormhole. Electromagnetic
radiation can travel in both directions through a wormhole,
but matter cannot.&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a wormhole is created, a vortex normally forms.
&lt;strong&gt;Warning: The vortex caused by the wormhole opening will
annihilate anything in its path.&lt;/strong&gt; Vortexes can be avoided when
using sufficiently advanced dialing technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;An obstruction in a gate will prevent it from accepting a
wormhole connection.&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

{{Notes_Section
|Usage=The '''mark''' element is a phrasing-level element. It must not contain block-level elements, but it can contain other phrasing-level elements.
|Notes=The '''mark''' element denotes the relevance of a span of text. By default, most browsers render it in black text on a yellow background, but you can change that with CSS.

To indicate importance, use [[html/elements/em|'''strong''']]; for emphasis, use [[html/elements/em|'''em''']].

When used in the main prose of a document, the '''mark''' element indicates a part of the document that has been highlighted. When used in a quotation or other block of text (such as an [[html/elements/aside|'''aside''']]), it indicates a highlight that was not originally present but which has been added to bring the reader's attention to a part of the text. For example, the following are valid uses for the '''mark''' element:

* Bring attention to a particular string of text.
* Highlight parts of document that match a search string.
* Enable body text to refer to a specific part of a quotation or code fragment.

Windows Internet ExplorerÂ 9.  The '''mark''' element is only supported for webpages displayed in IE9 Standards mode. For more information, see Defining Document Compatibility.
