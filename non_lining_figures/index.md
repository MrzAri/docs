# non lining figures

## non-lining figures

Characters, typically numerals, typeset with varying heights, some extending above the cap line or below the baseline. Contrast with [lining figures](/lining_figures), which are numerals of a consistent height that all share the same baseline and cap line, resulting in a consistently sized line. Also called old-style figures.
