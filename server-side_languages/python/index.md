== Summary ==
[http://python.org/ Python] is a dynamic programming language which emphasizes code readability. It is widely used in a variety of areas, most notably scientific computing and system administration, though it has recently gained much wider usage in web development.

=== Similarity with Javascript ===
* Functional programming features
* Dynamic typing

=== Features ===
* "Batteries-included" - numerous useful standard libraries included by default
* Object-Oriented
* Excellent support for string and lists operations
* Many web frameworks
* Many system utility tools and years of traction as server-side scripting language (if you need to do more advanced server-side tasks in the future)
* Strong community

[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/ WSGI] is the standard API for Python to talk to web servers and most (but not all) web frameworks support it. Understanding high level overview of WSGI interface may aid you in understand the control flow of your web requests when using Python as the backend.
