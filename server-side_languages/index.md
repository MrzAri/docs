{{Summary_Section|Server-side languages, as opposed to client-side languages, are programming languages that perform tasks on the server, before the page is sent to the browser for rendering. This site only provides limited information on server-side languages.}}

As described in the [[WPD:FAQ#Will_this_site_include_information_on_server-side_languages.2C_like_PHP.2C_Perl.2C_Ruby.2C_Python.2C_etc..3F|FAQ item]], Web Platform Docs does not intend to focus on server-side languages. Because they are so important, however, we provide basic introductions, and link to other, more definitive sites for each language.
