|Term=lorem ipsum
|Definition=In publishing, placeholder or filler text commonly used to demonstrate the structure and visual layout of a document by removing the distraction of meaningful content. The lorem ipsum text is typically derived from a section of a Latin text by Cicero with words altered, added and removed that make it nonsensical in meaning (and thus not proper Latin).
