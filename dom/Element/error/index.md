### Remarks

Fires the **onerror** event and passes the associated error to the **error** property. Error codes map directly to World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) file errors, as described in the following table.

Type
:   Description
NotFoundError
:   The resource ([**File**](/apis/file/File), [**Blob**](/apis/file/Blob), or [**msStream**](/w/index.php?title=apis/file/MSStream&action=edit&redlink=1)) could not be found at the time the read was processed.
SecurityError
:   One of the following occurred:
    -   The file being accessed is unsafe.
    -   The file has changed since the user selected it.
    -   Other security issues not covered by other error types.

NotReadableError
:   The resource could not be read. This may occur due to permission problems on the file.
EncodingError
:   The resource could not be encoded due to data URL length limitations.

Â  This property is `null` unless there is an error.
