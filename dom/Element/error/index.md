===Remarks===
An error that occurs during a call to the [[apis/file/methods/readAsBlob|'''readAsBlob''']] method fires the '''onerror''' event and passes the associated error to the '''error''' property.
Error codes map directly to World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) file errors, as described in the following table.
