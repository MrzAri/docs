|Notes====Remarks===
The [[apis/file/FileReader|'''FileReader''']] object can be in one of three states.
{{{!}} class="wikitable"
{{!}}-
!Constant
!Value
!Description
{{!}}-
{{!}}EMPTY
{{!}}0
{{!}}The [[apis/file/FileReader|'''FileReader''']] object has been constructed, and there are no pending reads. None of the read methods have been called. This is the default state of a newly created '''FileReader''' object, until one of the read methods has been called on it.
{{!}}-
{{!}}LOADING
{{!}}1
{{!}}A [[apis/file/File|'''File''']] or [[apis/file/Blob|'''Blob''']] is being read. One of the read methods is being processed, and no error has occurred during the read.
{{!}}-
{{!}}DONE
{{!}}2
{{!}}The entire [[apis/file/File|'''File''']] or [[apis/file/Blob|'''Blob''']] has been read into memory, a file error occurred during read, or the read was aborted using [[apis/file/FileReader/abort|'''abort''']]. The [[apis/file/FileReader|'''FileReader''']] is no longer reading a '''File''' or '''Blob'''. If <code>readyState</code> is set to <code>DONE</code> it means at least one of the read methods have been called on this '''FileReader''' object.
