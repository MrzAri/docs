===Remarks===
You must return the state of [[apis/file/MSStreamReader|'''msStreamReader''']] when getting the object. '''readyState''' is set only when the '''msStreamReader''' is created and by the [[apis/file/methods/readAsBlob|'''readAsBlob''']] method.
When the [[apis/file/MSStreamReader|'''msStreamReader''']] object is created, the state is set to <code>EMPTY</code>. When there is a call to the [[apis/file/methods/readAsBlob|'''readAsBlob''']] method, the state is set to <code>LOADING</code>. If '''readyState''' is set to <code>DONE</code>, it means that the '''readAsBlob''' method has been called at least once.
The [[apis/file/FileReader|'''FileReader''']] object can be in one of three states.

!Description
|-
|EMPTY
|0
|The [[apis/file/FileReader|'''FileReader''']] object has been constructed, and there are no pending reads. None of the read methods have been called. This is the default state of a newly created '''FileReader''' object, until one of the read methods has been called on it.
|-
|LOADING
|1
|A [[apis/file/File|'''File''']] or [[apis/file/Blob|'''Blob''']] is being read. One of the read methods is being processed, and no error has occurred during the read.
|-
|DONE
|2
|The entire [[apis/file/File|'''File''']] or [[apis/file/Blob|'''Blob''']] has been read into memory, a file error occurred during read, or the read was aborted using [[apis/file/methods/abort|'''abort''']]. The [[apis/file/FileReader|'''FileReader''']] is no longer reading a '''File''' or '''Blob'''. If <code>readyState</code> is set to <code>DONE</code> it means at least one of the read methods have been called on this '''FileReader''' object.
