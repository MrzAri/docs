<span data-meta="applies_to" data-type="key">Property of <span data-type="value">[dom/Element](/dom/Element)</span></span>

## Syntax

``` {.js}
var result = element.size;
element.size = value;
```

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.

## Notes

### Remarks

The **size** property returns the total number of bytes of the [**Blob**](/apis/file/Blob) object or `0` if the **Blob** has no bytes to read. Data accessed through the [**size**](/html/attributes/size_(hr)) property is returned synchronously.
