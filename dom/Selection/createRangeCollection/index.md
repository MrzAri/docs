# createRangeCollection

**Needs Summary**: This article does not have a summary. Summaries give a brief overview of the topic and are automatically included on some listing pages that link to this article.

*Method of [dom/Selection](/dom/Selection)*

## Syntax

``` {.js}
var object = object.createRangeCollection();
```

## Return Value

Returns an object of type DOM Node.

Object

Returns a collection of [**TextRange**](/dom/TextRange) objects.

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.

## Notes

### Remarks

Host applications can provide a multiple selection mechanism and can return a collection of [**TextRange**](/dom/TextRange) objects that represents discontinuous selections. The host application provides the collection through the **ISegmentList** interface. *MSHTML* requests this interface through the **ISelectionServices** interface. Microsoft Internet ExplorerÂ 5.5 does not provide multiple selection. The default implementation of this method returns a collection consisting of a single [**TextRange**](/dom/TextRange) object.
