var result = element.label;
element.label = value;
```

## Notes

### Remarks

A label can be any identifying string. This string is displayed in the HTML5 video player. For example, the following track element appears as "French language track" in the player: This property is not implemented for [**AudioTrack**](/apis/audio-video/AudioTrack). **Note**  To create timed text files in both Web Video Text Track (WebVTT) and Timed Text Markup Language (TTML) formats, see [HTML5 Video Caption Maker](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=251121) on the Windows Internet Explorer test drive site.
