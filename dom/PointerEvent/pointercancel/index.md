{{Summary_Section|Dispatched when either (1) the user agent has determined that a pointer is unlikely to continue to produce events (e.g., due to a hardware event), or (2) after having fired the [[dom/PointerEvent/pointerdown|pointerdown]] event, the pointer is subsequently used to manipulate the page viewport (e.g., panning or zooming).}}

{{Notes_Section
|Usage=This event occurs when the pointer (touch or pen contact) is removed from the system. Here are common reasons why this might happen:
* A touch contact is canceled by a pen coming into range of the surface. 
* The device doesn't report an active contact for more than 100ms.
* A mapping for a device's monitor changes while contacts are active. For example, the user changes the position of a screen in a two screen configuration. 
* The desktop is locked or the user logged off. 
* The number of simultaneous contacts exceeds the number that the device can support. For example, if a device supports only two contact points, if the user has two fingers on a surface, and then touches it with a third finger, this event is raised.
|Notes=When the pointercancel event is raised for a pointer, the app wonâ€™t receive any other events for that pointer, including pointerup . The app should perform any necessary cleanup as required for the pointer. For example, if the app maintains a pointer list, the app should remove the pointer from the list. 

You shouldn't treat this event like an pointerup event. When a pointer is removed, the app should cancel any ongoing work. The following example shows how you might handle pointer events if the target is a button:
