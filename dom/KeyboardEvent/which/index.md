# which

**Needs Summary**: This article does not have a summary. Summaries give a brief overview of the topic and are automatically included on some listing pages that link to this article.

<span data-meta="applies_to" data-type="key">Property of <span data-type="value">[dom/KeyboardEvent](/dom/KeyboardEvent)</span></span>

## Syntax

``` {.js}
var result = element.which;
element.which = value;
```

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.

## Notes

### Remarks

The **which** property is provided for compatibility only. The [**keyCode**](/dom/KeyboardEvent/keyCode) property is more widely supported; however, the [**key**](/dom/KeyboardEvent/key) property is recommended for international keyboard layouts and improved accessibility.

### Syntax

### Standards information

There are no standards that apply here.
