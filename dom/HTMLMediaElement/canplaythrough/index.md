## Notes

The **oncanplaythrough** event is raised when data is being fetched at a rate that would allow playback without interruption at the [**defaultPlaybackRate**](/dom/HTMLMediaElement/defaultPlaybackRate). If the [**autoplay**](/dom/HTMLMediaElement/autoplay) attribute is specified, the video starts playing when **oncanplaythrough** is received. This event occurs after [**oncanplay**](/dom/HTMLMediaElement/canplay) and before the first [**onprogress**](/dom/HTMLMediaElement/progress) event is received. To invoke this event, load a media resource.
