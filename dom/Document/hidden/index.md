===Remarks===
The '''Visibility''' API provides Web applications with the means to programmatically determine the current visibility of a page and be notified of visibility changes.
You can use this property to determine whether a page is visible or not. If it is not visible, you can throttle page activity and resource usage to create more power- and CPU-efficient applications.
This is a property of the '''document''' object.  You can also use the [[apis/timing/properties/visibilityState|'''visibilityState''']] property to learn more about the page visibility state and also use the [[apis/timing/properties/visibilitychange|'''visibilitychanged''']] event to determine when a state changes.
