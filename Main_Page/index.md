= Welcome to Web Platform Docs =
  
Web Platform Docs is a new community-driven site that aims to become a comprehensive and authoritative source for web developer documentation. Even though Web Platform Docs is still in alpha, you can already find lots of valuable content on the site, including information on:

* How to use features of the open web, with syntax and examples
* What platforms and devices you can use various technologies on
* What is the current standardization, stability and implementation status of each technology specification

In the future, Web Platform Docs will include even more content for you to explore such as live code examples, resources for educators and much more. To get there faster, we’d like to invite you to also contribute your knowledge. We hope you will join us!
