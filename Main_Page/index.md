= Welcome to Web Platform Docs =
  
Web Platform Docs is your canonical resource for up-to-date information on open web standards. We have a wealth of information available, including reference docs to look up syntax and the latest browser support information, and tutorials and guides to teach and learn web design techniques.
  
Bear in mind that this is an early alpha release. In the future, there will be a lot more features for example translation facilities, resources for teachers, live code examples and more.

We would love your help in improving the content in any way you can &mdash; if you see problems on any pages, fix them, add a note to the article, or get in contact with us using any of the other methods available below. We are also looking for people to contribute new material!
