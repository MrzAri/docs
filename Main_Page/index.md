= Welcome to Web Platform Docs =
  
Web Platform Docs is your canonical resource for up-to-date information on open web standards. We have a wealth of information available, including reference docs to look up syntax and the latest browser support information, and tutorials and guides to teach and learn web design techniques.
  
Bear in mind that this is an early alpha release. In the future, there will be a lot more features for example translation facilities, resources for teachers, live code examples and more.
