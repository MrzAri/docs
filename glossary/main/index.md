Term
:   Definition
[absolute unit](/absolute_unit)
:   In CSS, length units that are dependent on the output medium. Absolute units include in (inch), cm (centimeter), mm (millimeter), pt (point), and pc (pica). Contrast with [relative unit](/relative_unit).
[alignment](/alignment)
:   The horizontal or vertical positioning of an element. Typical horizontal alignments include left, right, and center; typical vertical alignments include baseline, sub, super, top, text-top, middle, bottom, and text-bottom.
[ascender](/ascender)
:   The upward-pointing stem of a letter, such as "d" or "h", that extends toward the cap line.
[baseline](/baseline)
:   The line on which the lowest terminals of most commonly used letters, such as "n" or "e", rest, excepting those with descenders, such as "g" or "p". The line as a whole is said to rest on the baseline.
[blowout](/blowout)
:   An event where a layout renders in an unexpected and generally undesirable way. Blowouts typically inform future test cases of the layout.
[bold](/bold)
:   Of a font or typeface, having thicker strokes than its normal form. The last word in this sentence is **bold**.
[brute force](/brute_force)
:   An unskilled, inelegant coding style in which the developer relies on a computer’s processing power to achieve a result instead of crafting orderly, efficient code.
[cap line](/cap_line)
:   The line met by the top terminals of most uppercase letters, such as "H" or "R", and sometimes exceeded by the ascenders of some lowercase letters, such as "b" or "k".
[centered](/centered)
:   A form of typographical justification that positions an element horizontally equidistant from the left and right edges of its container element.
[character](/character)
:   A letter, number, or symbol, such as "Y", "4", or "%".
[character encoding](/character_encoding)
:   A precisely-defined correspondence between characters and the numbers used to represent them in electronic systems, intended to achieve consistent storage, transmission, or display of data. Common character encoding schemes include ASCII, Unicode, and UTF-8.
[character set](/character_set)
:   The full range of characters in a font used for electronic documents, in which each character assumes a unique code position within the font.
[code position](/code_position)
:   The decimal or hexadecimal location of a character's bit encoding (number) within its character set.
[container element](/container_element)
:   A parent element that comprises one or more child elements. A container element typically determines the content flow and/or positioning context of its child elements.
[copy](/copy)
:   A broad term for content delivered by a document's author. May include text, images, tables, links, lists, etc.
[descender](/descender)
:   The downward-pointing stem of a letter, such as "p" or "y", that extends below the baseline.
[edge case](/edge_case)
:   In a layout, a design requirement or issue that is confined to a proportionally small number of elements or documents.
[em](/em)
:   A unit of typographical measurement equal to the currently specified point size. Originally derived from the width of the uppercase "M" in the given typeface, this unit ensures consistency across all fonts at a given point size. Thus, 1 em in a 16-point font is 16 points.
[en](/en)
:   A unit of typographical measurement equal to one-half the currently specified point size. Originally derived from the width of the lowercase "n" in the given typeface, this unit ensures consistency across all fonts at a given point size. Thus, 1 en in a 16-point font is 8 points.
[flush](/flush)
:   In a layout, a state in which no whitespace is present between two content elements, or between a content element and the edge of its container element.
[flush left](/flush_left)
:   A form of typographical justification that positions an element horizontally at the left edge of its container element. As applied to text, also called ragged right.
[flush right](/flush_right)
:   A form of typographical justification that positions an element horizontally at the right edge of its container element. As applied to text, also called ragged left.
[font](/font)
:   The collection of characters in a given style and/or weight, e.g., normal, **bold**, or *italic*, for a particular typeface.
[functional notation](/functional_notation)
:   To provide property values in CSS in a format that resembles a function call, e.g., `body {background-image:url("mybg.gif");}`.
[generic font family](/generic_font_family)
:   In CSS, a broad class of similar fonts used in a prioritized list of fonts. Common generic font families include serif (such as Times New Roman, Bodoni, and Garamond), sans-serif (such as MS Arial, MS Verdana, and Univers), and monospace (such as Courier, MS Courier New, and Prestige).
[CSS Keyword](/glossary/items/CSS_Keyword)
:   A CSS keyword is a literal string that has a special meaning when used as a value for a css property. Examples: `inherit`, `smaller`, `white`.
[glyph](/glyph)
:   A single letter, number, symbol, or ligature within a given font. Usually, but not always, a synonym for character.
[grid](/grid)
:   A composition device used to ensure that all elements in a layout will appear at coordinates that can be easily predicted. Effective grid use can make a layout more coherent and improve readability and comprehension of the content.
[gutter](/gutter)
:   The whitespace present between two adjacent margins, apparent as a result of justification, bordering, or rule placement.
[hanging punctuation](/hanging_punctuation)
:   A typographical method of placing punctuation marks, such as quotation marks and bullets, so that they do not disrupt the flow of a body of text or break the margin of alignment. So named because the punctuation appears to "hang" in the margin, and is not incorporated into the block or column of text. Also called exdentation.
[hyphenation](/hyphenation)
:   The practice of separating words at syllable boundaries with a hyphen character (-) in order to make them fit better on a line and avoid unnecessary trailing whitespace. Modern editing software has refined the text justification process, making hyphenation largely superfluous. Also called syllabication.
[italic](/italic)
:   Of a font or typeface, a style somewhat emulating cursive writing that slants characters slightly. The last word in this sentence is *italic*.
[justification](/justification)
:   The typographical practice of aligning multiple lines of text precisely to one or both of their common margins. Typically referred to in its individual forms as left, right, center, or full justification.
[justified](/justified)
:   A form of typographical justification that positions text to align precisely with both its left and right margins, usually accomplished by incrementally increasing or decreasing word spacing (and sometimes letter spacing) by minute amounts. Also called fully-justified.
[kerning](/kerning)
:   The typographical process of adjusting the spacing between individual characters in a line of text rendered in a proportional font to achieve a visually pleasing result.
[KISS](/kiss)
:   Acronym for "Keep It Simple, Stupid", "Keep It Short and Simple", etc. Based on the principle that reducing complexity in a system (typically a factor of the number of system elements) reduces the potential for errors, and thus that the avoidance of unnecessary complexity should be a key goal in any design effort.
[leading](/leading)
:   In typography, the (typically vertical) distance between adjacent lines of type. So called because during the era of offset printing, this space was controlled by inserting strips of lead between lines of type to separate them.
[letter spacing](/letter_spacing)
:   In typography, the amount of space between a group of letters, adjusted to affect density in a line or block of text. Also called *tracking*, and often confused with kerning.
[ligature](/ligature)
:   A typographic method by which two or more glyphs are combined into one, with the resulting single glyph replacing the original two consecutive characters. Common Latin alphabet ligatures include & (combining "E" and "t"), Æ (combining "A" and "E"), and ß (combining "s" and "s" or "s" and "z").
[lining figures](/lining_figures)
:   Characters, typically numerals, of a consistent height that all share the same baseline and cap line, resulting in a consistently sized line. Contrast with [non-lining figures](/non_lining_figures), which are numerals typeset with varying heights, some extending above the cap line or below the baseline.
[lorem ipsum](/lorem_ipsum)
:   In publishing, placeholder or filler text commonly used to demonstrate the structure and visual layout of a document by removing the distraction of meaningful content. The lorem ipsum text is typically derived from a section of a Latin text by Cicero with words altered, added and removed that make it nonsensical in meaning (and thus not proper Latin). For example, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisici elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
[mean line](/mean_line)
:   Of a font, a point exactly half the distance from the baseline to the cap line. This is often, but not necessarily, the height of the lowercase letters (the x-height). Also called midline.
[monospaced font](/monospaced_font)
:   A font whose characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal space, such that typically-narrow letters like "i" and typically-wide letters like "w" are the same width. Also called fixed-pitch or fixed-width font. `This sentence is in a monospaced font.` Contrast with [proportional font](/proportional_font).
[non-lining figures](/non_lining_figures)
:   Characters, typically numerals, typeset with varying heights, some extending above the cap line or below the baseline. Contrast with [lining figures](/lining_figures), which are numerals of a consistent height that all share the same baseline and cap line, resulting in a consistently sized line. Also called old-style figures.
[oblique](/oblique)
:   A form of type that slants slightly to the right, used in the same manner as italic type. Unlike italic, however, it does not use different glyph shapes; it uses the same glyphs, but distorted by slanting. Often confused with italic.
[orphan](/orphan)
:   A word or short line at the beginning of a paragraph that is left dangling at the bottom of a column or page, separated from the rest of the paragraph by the subsequent break. The Chicago Manual of Style offers these definitions:

    -   A paragraph-opening line that appears by itself at the bottom of a page/column.
    -   A word, part of a word, or very short line that appears by itself at the end of a paragraph. Orphans result in too much white space between paragraphs or at the bottom of a page.

    Contrast with [widow](/widow).

[pagination](/pagination)
:   The process, manual or automatic, of dividing content into separate pages, either electronic or printed. The latter is often simply an instance of the former, rendered to print.
[pica](/pica)
:   A typographical unit of measure corresponding to 1/72 of a foot, and therefore equal to 1/6 of an inch. The pica contains 12 point units of measure.
[point](/point)
:   The smallest unit of typographical measure (a subdivision of the pica). The current desktop publishing point is defined as 72 points to the inch (1 point = 1/72 inch). There are thus 12 points in a pica.
[proportional font](/proportional_font)
:   A font whose characters occupy different amounts of horizontal space, such that typically-narrow letters like "i" and typically-wide letters like "w" are not the same width. Also called variable-pitch font. This entire definition is in a proportional font. Contrast with [monospaced font](/monospaced_font).
