==About==
Making an output of "Hello World!" is one of the first things you do when learning a new programming language. It's similar to learning chopsticks as your first song on piano. In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a script that will produce this output.

==The tutorial==
# Create a new file called helloworld.php
# Put the following text in that file

 <html>
 <body>
 <?
 echo "Hello World!";
 ?>
 </body>
 </html>
# Upload the file to a PHP enabled server, or if you prepare download PHP for your computer. I recommend using WAMP on windows.

==Closing Notes==
I hope you enjoyed my first tutorial and that this has helped you.
