{{Summary_Section|Modernizr is a JavaScript library that detects HTML5 and CSS3 features in the userâ€™s browser.}}
{{Tutorial
|Content= == Why use Modernizr? ==

As web grows we are getting something new every day. And obviously all new features are not supported in all browsers. But some browsers like Chrome, Safari keeps updating as per the new features. So what about the browsers which don't support new features (e.g. IE7 for HTML5). Here Modernizr comes into picture. Modernizr is used to detect the browser support of any HTML5 feature.

== How it Works? ==

Modernizr runs on page load to detect the features after that it creates a JavaScript object with the result and adds classes to the html element for you to key your CSS on.
