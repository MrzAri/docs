{{Summary_Section|We cannot live without internet. Every day we visit thousands of websites, but we fail to notice something. We get a different layout based on the size of the viewport. Most popular website's have a different experience for each device, whether it be a mobile, a tablet, or a desktop. The problem is that you get redirected to a different page, like m.yourwebsite.com.

But thats old technology. Today we have seen great improvements in the web development due to HTML5. With HTML5 websites can automatically resize themselves according to the display. This is known as the Responsive web design. 

In such type of design there is no need of an additional sub domain. Such websites make use of Web Kit which is offered in HTML5. All the modern browsers like Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, IE etc support HTML5. 

Mozilla Firefox has a different HTML5 webkit for its browsers. So every time a website is designed an extra line of code is added for Mozilla Firefox. For easier coding there are CSS grids which users can use to make their website responsive if they have no clue on to do that. One of the most famous responsive grid systems is Bootstrap by Twitter.

The major advantage of this design is that all the displays will give similar desktop like feel. The website which is responsive goes through a lot of coding as it has to be made optimal for tablets and mobile displays as well. So additional code is added for these displays.
