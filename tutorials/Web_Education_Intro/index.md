===Train the trainers, or "Think web" ===

The idea behind this resource, which has bene sitting on Chris Mills' hard drive for a year or so, is an advocacy guide for developers, designers, and other members of the web community to use to deliver training and advocacy about web standards and best practices to educators and school/college administrators. A kind of "do it yourself" advocacy guide, as it were. This might well be useful, if someone can find the time to create an activity to develop this material:

=== "Your first web site"  series ===

The below articles were written from the point of view of a short, low level set of articles for a complete beginner to use to put together their own HTML/CSS site without any previous knowledge whatsoever, and for it to be a quicker operation than reading the whole web standards curriculum and learning to be a professional developer. This series is lower level than the WSC, and doesn't aim to teach you everything you need to know. It aims to give you enough to get a quick solution or to get your hands dirty, to see you through until you get a proper solution or learning experience created.

* [[Your first web site Part 1 - How the web works]]
* [[Your first web site Part 2 - HTML elements in detail]]
* [[Your first web site Part 3 - CSS, the styling languge of the Web]]
* [[Your first web site Part 4 - Styling the template with CSS]]
* [[Your first web site Part 5 - Getting your stuff on to the Web]]

As it stands, the material needs a good deal of editing and updating, but it could well be useful.

=== Web standards and accessibility course for marketers ===

We should also consider creating a course for marketers and other non-technical business people to help them understand what they need to know about web standards, accessibility etc. Misunderstanding of technical properties by non-technical team members is a common cause of problems in the effectiveness of web projects. It's not just developers/designers we need to target.
