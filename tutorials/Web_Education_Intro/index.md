===Train the trainers, or "Think web" ===

The idea behind this resource, which has bene sitting on Chris Mills' hard drive for a year or so, is an advocacy guide for developers, designers, and other members of the web community to use to deliver training and advocacy about web standards and best practices to educators and school/college administrators. A kind of "do it yourself" advocacy guide, as it were. This might well be useful, if someone can find the time to create an activity to develop this material:
