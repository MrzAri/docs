|Content===Introduction==
Haxe is a ''multi-platform'', open-source programming language, which is able to compile to many programming languages - most notably, JavaScript. It is very similar syntactically to Java and Actionscript 3, and so will feel very similar to a lot of programmers. It is object-oriented with the usual such as classes and interfaces, however it features another interesting concept: a type definition (or typedef). This will either act as a referral to another class, or a 'template' for Dynamic objects.
