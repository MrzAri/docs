== What you should already know ==

This guide assumes you have the following basic background:

* A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
* Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language ([[HTML]]).

Some programming experience with a language such as C or Visual Basic is useful, but not required.

== Where to find JavaScript information ==


* [[/guides/JavaScript|JavaScript Guide]] (this guide) provides information about JavaScript language and its objects.
* [[/js | JavaScript Reference]] provides reference material for the JavaScript language.

If you are new to JavaScript, start with the JavaScript Guide. Once you have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, you can use the JavaScript Reference to get more details on individual objects and statements.

== Tips for learning JavaScript ==
Getting started with JavaScript is easy: all you need is a modern Web browser. This guide includes some JavaScript features which are only currently available in the latest versions of modern browsers, so using the most recent version of your browser is recommended.

== An interactive interpreter ==

An interactive JavaScript prompt is an invaluable aid to learning the language, as it enables you to try things out interactively without having to save a file and refresh a page. Here are tools in various browsers that help you create and debug JavaScript code:

* Firefox Developer Tools
* Firebug, an add-on for Firefox
* Chrome Developer Tools
* Opera Dragonfly
* Internet Explorer Developer Tools
* Safari Developer Tools

== Document conventions ==

JavaScript applications run on many operating systems; the information in this book applies to all versions. File and directory paths are given in Windows format (with backslashes separating directory names). For Unix versions, the directory paths are the same, except that you use slashes instead of backslashes to separate directories.

This guide uses uniform resource locators (URLs) of the following form:

<code>http://''server.domain/path/file''.html</code>

In these URLs, ''server'' represents the name of the server on which you run your application, such as <code>research1</code> or <code>www</code>; <code>domai</code> represents your Internet domain name, such as example.com; ''path'' represents the directory structure on the server; and ''file''.html represents an individual file name. In general, items in italics in URLs are placeholders and items in normal monospace font are literals. If your server has Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enabled, you would use <code>https</code> instead of <code>http</code> in the URL.

This guide uses the following font conventions:

* The <code>monospace font</code> is used for sample code and code listings, API and language elements (such as method names and property names), file names, path names, directory names, HTML tags, and any text that must be typed on the screen. (Monospace italic font is used for placeholders embedded in code.)
* ''Italic'' type is used for book titles, emphasis, variables and placeholders, and words used in the literal sense.
* '''Boldface''' type is used for glossary terms.
