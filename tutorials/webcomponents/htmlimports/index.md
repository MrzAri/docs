{{Summary_Section|'''HTML Imports''', part of Web Components, is a way to include HTML documents in other HTML documents. An import can include CSS, JavaScript, or anything else an .html file can contain. }}

|Content===Why imports?==

Think about how you load different types of resources on the web. For JS, we have <code><script src></code>. For CSS, your go-to is probably <code><link rel="stylesheet"></code>. For images it's <code><img></code>. Video has <code><video></code>. Audio, <code><audio></code>... Get to the point! The majority of the web's content has a simple and declarative way to load itself. Not so for HTML. Here's your options:

#'''<iframe>''' - tried and true but heavy weight. An iframe's content lives entirely in a separate context than your page. While that's mostly a great feature, it creates additional challenges (shrink wrapping the size of the frame to its content is tough, insanely frustrating to script into/out of, nearly impossible to style).
#'''AJAX''' - [http://ericbidelman.tumblr.com/post/31140607367/mashups-using-cors-and-responsetype-document I love xhr.responseType="document"], but you're saying I need JS to load HTML? That doesn't seem right.
#'''CrazyHacksâ„¢''' - embedded in strings, hidden as comments (e.g., <code><script type="text/html"></code>). Yuck!

See the irony? The web's most basic content, HTML, requires the greatest amount of effort to work with. Fortunately, [http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/explainer/ Web Components] are here to get us back on track.
