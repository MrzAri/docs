|Content=Designing a website is not quite like designing a chair. Your designing process needs to answer the technical requirements and an appropriate look'n'feel. First because you don't want your users to fall at the moment they sit on your chair, and second because if you want them to use, and perhaps buy this chair, it needs to be attractive and comfortable. If your final object is superb but no one can sit on it, you didn't conceive a chair but just a piece of art in some way. Congratulations, you're an artist but you're not a designer. If your chair was a website, users would have a look at it, say « wow, it's nice » but would they use it? No.

If your chair is the most comfortable in the world but it looks like a torture device to sit on it, who would buy it? Who would use it? You need to make it look comfortable to make people want to sit on it.

Designing a website is finding the good balance between usability and aesthetics dimensions while having a thought about the technical part all along the process.

Aesthetics
Building a website with strong aesthetics is not building the prettier website. It needs to be consistent. For example, people believe they make better deals on an old looking website when searching for secondhand object.

Usability
Usability is taking care of the users. It doesn't mean it must be easy to use, it means it's appropriate to its users: a professional interface could bear a lot of data on a single page, but it has to suit its users needs. And it won't use the same words as a website made for children would!

UX. Once forgotten, the usability of a website is now having all spotlights on. A term has been made to help people remembering this part of the design process: UX Design. User eXperience design.
