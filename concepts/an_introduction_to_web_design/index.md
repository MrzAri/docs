|Content=Designing a website isn't unlike designing a chair. You're conceiving process need to answer the technical requirement and an appropriate look'n feel. Firstly because you don't want your users to fall at the moment they sit on it and secondly because if you want them to use, and perhaps buy this chair, it needs to be attractive and comfortable. If your final object is superb but no one can sit on, you didn't conceive a chair but some kind of a piece of art. Congratulation, you're an artist but you're not a designer. If you're chair were a website, users would have a look at it, say « wow, it's nice » but would they use it? No.
If you're chair is the most comfortable in the world but it looks like a torture device to sit on who would buy it? Who would use it? You need to make it looking comfortable to have people sitting on it. 

Designing a website is finding the good balance between the usability and the aesthetic components while having a thought about the technical part all along the process. 

Aesthetic
Building a website with a strong aesthetic is not building the prettier website. It needs to be consistent. For example, people believe they make better deals on an old looking website when searching for secondhand object. 

Usability
Usability is taking care of the users. It doesn't mean it must be easy to use, it means it's appropriate to its users: a professional interface could need a lot of informations on a same page, but it suits its users need. And it won't use the same words as a website made for child ! 

UX. Once forgotten, the usability of website is now having spotlight on. A term has been made to help people remembering this part of the design process: UX Design. User Experience design.
