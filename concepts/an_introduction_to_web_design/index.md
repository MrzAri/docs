{{Concept_Page
|Content=The primary goal when designing for the web is usefulness. It should work on any browser (within reason) and a variety of platforms. This requires that you think upfront about user experience. 

Aesthetics
Building a website with strong aesthetics is not building the prettier website. It needs to be consistent. For example, people believe they make better deals on an old looking website when searching for secondhand object.

Usability
Usability is taking care of the users. It doesn't mean it must be easy to use, it means it's appropriate to its users: a professional interface could bear a lot of data on a single page, but it has to suit its users needs. And it won't use the same words as a website made for children would!

UX. Once forgotten, the usability of a website is now having all spotlights on. A term has been made to help people remembering this part of the design process: UX Design. User eXperience design.
