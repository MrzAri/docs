|Content=The primary goal when designing for the web is usefulness. Your website should work on any browser (within reason) and on a variety of platforms. This requires that you think upfront about the user experience. 

=== Aesthetics ===
Building a website with strong aesthetics doesn't necessarily mean building a pretty website. It needs to be thematically consistent with the content. For example, visitors would expect a secondhand store to use old-fashioned design elements and professional enterprise-focused sites tend to use muted color schemes and a rigid site structure.

=== Usability ===
Usability focuses on providing the means to navigate your website and allowing access to the content. Nested menus, breadcrumbs, sidebars and footers are all a part of providing a useful interface to your visitors. That said, not all websites need to encompass all these elements to provide a useful user experience. It all depends on the target audience, whether it be children who would be more interested in non-conventional menus that evoke emotion or business-oriented individuals who want to go straight to the meat of the content.

The concept of User Experience design (abbreviated to UX) is becoming a popular topic to focus on when building modern websites. Design is more than just the visual impression of a website, but also how it works and whom it is meant to work for.
