{{Summary_Section|Does designing for the web differ from designing a chair? No, it doesn't. Both need to make usability, aesthetic and technic work together to serve the product pupose and its users.}}
{{Concept_Page
|Content=== The design process == 
When a designer conceives a chair, he needs think about the technic requirements, the product aesthetic and the user ease:
* If the final object is superb but no one can sit on it, he didn't conceive a chair but just a piece of art. 
* If the chair is the most comfortable in the world but it looks like a torture device to sit on it, who would even try it? The chair he conceives must have a coherent look'n feel: it should offer a proper experience to its users.

For a chair like for the Web, Designing is conceiving a product for its users. It is a process where technical constraints, aesthetic and usability meet in order to serve a purpose for its targets. Design must focus on existing and future users. Designing for the WEB is not just about graphics/aesthetics, rather it applies to all the overarching work going towards ensuring that the Web project meets its purpose for its target audience.
