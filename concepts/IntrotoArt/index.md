What is beauty depends on many things, one being the observer. However, there is commonness in what we like as human beings and dislike, genetics? Perhaps. When it comes to Graphic Design not only the object/concept has to look cute but serve its purpose. This sometimes is refereed to as functionality vs aesthetics. Creativity lies in finding the best and better technique that requires the minimum compromise. 

In short Graphic Design looks beautiful and serve a function. While Art is meant to be expression of feelings,or to convey feeling and is extraordinary, it may or may not serve any other function.

Graphic Design is meant to communicate the message. And interactive apps it's suppose to deliever the experince. Experience include many things which are beyond the scope of this article such as smartness of app, customization, and more. But one rule of thumb is this. Don't make user work hard. Be a source of aid not obstacles. When designing the whole experience think of your app as a person who wants to help the user, have common sense and see what the user meant. 

In General, Graphic Design can be broken down into these elements:


*Typography
*Color
*Line
*Shape
*Spacing
*Positioning
*Mass
*texture
*Balance
*Proximity
*Consistency
*Contrast
*Movement
*rhytm/toneOfmessage/Theme
