***Minification*** is the process of transforming a file in a way such that while the functionality of the input file are kept unchanged, the resulting file is much smaller. Minification often consists of removing white spaces, comments, new line characters and block delimiters, and other optimizations. This is particularly useful in JavaScript and with any web technologies because minification generally reduces the amount of data to transport across networks, and therefore helps decrease page load times.

Minification is often used automatically as part of a build process. One of the advantages of code minification is that it can also be used to validate your code, since invalid code obviously cannot be parsed and minified.
