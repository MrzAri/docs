Minification is the process of transforming a file in a way such that unnecessary characters are removed and the functionalities of the input file are kept unchanged. Minification often consists of removing white spaces, comments, new line characters and block delimiters. This is particularly useful in JavaScript and with any web technologies because minification generally reduces the size of the original file, which therefore reduces the amount of data to transport across networks.

The Google closure compiler is an example of a tool that can be used to minify JavaScript. Different modes of minification can be selected: white space only, simple or advanced. One of the advantages of using the Google Closure Compiler to minify your JavaScript is that is can also warn you about incorrect code. You can be sure to have no syntax errors. It can also identify code patterns that are not consistently handled in all browsers, such as trailing commas in arrays (a = [1,2,]).
