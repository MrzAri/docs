==History of Javascript==

===Birth at Netscape===
JavaScript was originally developed in Netscape, by Brendan Eich. Battling with Microsoft over the Internet, Netscape considered their client-server solution as a distributed OS, running a portable version of Sun Microsystems' Java. Because Java was a competitor of C++ and aimed at professional programmers, Netscape also wanted a lightweight interpreted language that would complement Java by appealing to nonprofessional programmers, like Microsoft's VB.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Severance |first=Charles |year=2012 |month=February |title=Java Script: Designing a Language in 10 Days |journal=Computer |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=7â€“8 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/abs/html/mags/co/2012/02/mco2012020007.htm |accessdate=23 April 2012 |doi=10.1109/MC.2012.57 }}</ref> (see JavaScript and Java)
Developed under the name Mocha, LiveScript was the official name for the language when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but it was renamed JavaScript<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070916144913/http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease67.html Press release announcing JavaScript], "Netscape and Sun announce Javascript", PR Newswire, December 4, 1995</ref> when it was deployed in the Netscape browser version 2.0B3.<ref name="techvision">{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080208124612/http://wp.netscape.com/comprod/columns/techvision/innovators_be.html |archivedate=2008-02-08 |title=TechVision: Innovators of the Net: Brendan Eich and JavaScript |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= }}</ref>
The change of name from LiveScript to JavaScript roughly coincided with Netscape adding support for Java technology in its Netscape Navigator web browser. The final choice of name caused confusion, giving the impression that the language was a spin-off of the Java programming language, and the choice has been characterized by many as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot new web programming language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/basics/languages_on_the_internet.php3 |title=Programming languages used on the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) |publisher=Webdevelopersnotes.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://safari.oreilly.com/0596101996/jscript5-CHP-1 |title=O'Reilly - Safari Books Online - 0596101996 - JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, 5th Edition |publisher=Safari.oreilly.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref> It has also been claimed that the language's name is the result of a co-marketing deal between Netscape and Sun, in exchange for Netscape bundling Sun's Java runtime with its then-dominant browser.

===Server-side JavaScript===
Netscape introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with Netscape Enterprise Server, first released in December, 1994 (soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers).[14][15] Since the mid-2000s, there has been a proliferation of server-side JavaScript implementations. Node.js is one recent notable example of server-side JavaScript being used in real-world applications.[16][17]
===Adoption by Microsoft===
JavaScript very quickly gained widespread success as a client-side scripting language for web pages. Microsoft introduced JavaScript support in its own web browser, Internet Explorer, in version 3.0, released in August 1996.[18][not in citation given] Microsoft's webserver, Internet Information Server, introduced support for server-side scripting in JavaScript with release 3.0 (1996). Microsoft started to promote webpage scripting using the umbrella term Dynamic HTML.
Microsoft's JavaScript implementation was later renamed JScript to avoid trademark issues. JScript added new date methods to fix the Y2K-problematic methods in JavaScript, which were based on Java's java.util.Date class.
===Standardization===
In November 1996, Netscape announced that it had submitted JavaScript to Ecma International for consideration as an industry standard, and subsequent work resulted in the standardized version named ECMAScript.[19]
===Later developments===
JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages on the web. Initially, however, many professional programmers denigrated the language because its target audience was web authors and other such "amateurs", among other reasons.[20] The advent of Ajax returned JavaScript to the spotlight and brought more professional programming attention. The result was a proliferation of comprehensive frameworks and libraries, improved JavaScript programming practices, and increased usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers, as seen by the proliferation of server-side JavaScript platforms.
In January 2009, the CommonJS project was founded with the goal of specifying a common standard library mainly for JavaScript development outside the browser.[21]
