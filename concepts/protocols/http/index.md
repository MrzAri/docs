==HTTP==

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol. HTTP is an application-level protocol on top of [[TCP/IP]], a communication protocol. It is used for exchanging messages (such has hypermedia documents) in between a client (browser, bots) and a server. The interactions are defined by a client-server model. The client sends a request to a server and the server sends back a response to the client.

HTTP will help manage an information space by defining user interactions and expectations with regards to this information.
