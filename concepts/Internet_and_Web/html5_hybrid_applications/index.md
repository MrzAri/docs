{{API_Name}}
{{Summary_Section|A "hybrid" approach to application development suggests a native based application that partly relies on web technologies to render and power certain aspects or areas of the application. HTML5 offers many new features that can be leveraged through a web rendering engine such as webkit and can be utilized without being an application that is 100% powered by web technologies.}}
