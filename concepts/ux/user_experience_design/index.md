|Content=Designing a website is not about finding pretty colors and using nice fonts. No, it's not. A website provides services, contents and/or informations to its users. And this tool should not be build only for our own will but to meet the needs. Taking care of our users by designing a tool usable, understandable and meeting our and their expectation, it is User eXperience design. 

== eXperience == 

If the User part is easily comprehensible, why should we design an experience? The first thing we think about when we hear â€œdesign a web site" is the User Interface and this is really big part of the design process. But this is far from being the sole part, we also find, among other, web performances, interactions design (Is the text underlined if it is clickable?) 
and copywriting (Is my content understandable by the user?). An experience is literally an event leading to an awareness. The event being the time the user will spent at our website. 

== a definition == 
Designing the user experience, it is to optimize our website to ensure that the time users spend on our site is the most efficient.
