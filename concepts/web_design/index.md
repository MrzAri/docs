{{Summary_Section|For most people, the Web is not a command prompt, nor is it simply text. The Web has become all things to all people: a newspaper, a community discussion board, a photo gallery, a gaming venue. How can you attract people to your website and keep them coming back for more?}}
{{Basic Page}}
For a website to attract attention and keep it, the website must be a balance of functionality and usability. A website that looks wonderful and does nothing will attract attention, but likely will not keep it. A website that works well and looks like a command prompt may have a cult following, but will attract little attention outside of that. The following pages intend to help you make a website with that balance of functionality and usability.
