==Finding Your WAI ("way") to New Web Accessibility Resources==
  
  
Presentations you can copy, business case resources, what to do when you come across an inaccessible website, and much much more are available on the [http://www.w3.org/WAI/ WAI website] for '''managers, policy makers, presenters, developers, designers, and people with disabilities'''.

 
Whether you already use WAI resources or you're new to web accessibility, we encourage you to look around and find more information that is useful to you. This page explains strategies for finding what you're looking for on the WAI website. (A separate page provides [[Help with the WAI Web Site]], such as navigating with headings.)

 
If you don't find what you're looking for or have any suggestions on what you do find, please let us know by sending e-mail to:

 
* [[mailto:wai-eo-editors@w3.org wai-eo-editors@w3.org]] if you want your e-mail publicly archived.
* [[mailto:wai@w3.org wai@w3.org]] if you want your e-mail to go only to WAI staff. Please indicate if we may forward it to a public list anonymously, with your name and contact information removed.
 
== New Resources ==
 
We think you'll find some documents that you didn't even know existed on the WAI website. Some of them are in Draft stage as we gather more feedback. For example, here are just a few:

 
* '''[[http://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/ BAD - the Before and After Demonstration]]''' shows an inaccessible website and a retrofitted version of the same   website with the accessibility barriers fixed. It includes in-line notes   (&quot;annotations&quot;) for you to get more information, and evaluation reports   that list the accessibility problems for each page.
* [[http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/accessible How to Make Presentations Accessible to All]] helps you make your presentations, talks, meetings, and training accessible to all of your potential audience, including people with disabilities and others.
* [[http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/inaccessible Contacting Organizations about Inaccessible Websites]] includes tips and sample e-mails for telling organizations about accessibility barriers on their website.
* [[http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/resources.html Resources for Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization]] has statistics, case studies, and articles.
* [[http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/involving.html Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility]] describes how project managers, designers, and developers can better understand accessibility issues and implement more effective accessibility solutions in their websites,  tools,  and technical specifications.
* [[http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/Overview.html Developing Web Accessibility Presentations and Training]] offers materials for speakers and trainers to help their participants understand more about web accessibility.

* [[http://www.w3.org/WAI/highlights/archive Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Highlights Archive]] for past publication announcements.
* The &quot;Documents Under Review by WAI IG&quot; section of the [[http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/ WAI Interest Group (IG)]] page for a list of the draft documents that we're currently working on.
 
== Look through the Website Navigation ==
 
Click through the website navigation, which we revised in March 2011. In most visual browsers the navigation is in the light blue box on the left of most pages. Screen reader users and those without CSS can find the navigation under &quot;Site Navigation&quot; heading level two.

 
When you click on a navigation topic (Getting Started, Designing for Inclusion, 
Guidelines &amp; Techniques, etc.) you get a page that briefly explains the documents that are listed under that navigation topic.

 
== Use the Site Map ==
 
'''Go to the [[http://www.w3.org/WAI/sitemap WAI Site Map]]. Use the Find-on-page functionality to look for a specific word.'''

 
Find is often under the &quot;Edit&quot; menu, and the shortcut key for it is often Ctrl+F. Some browsers pop up a Find dialog box. Others add a strip at the top or bottom of the browser where you enter the words to find.

 
The WAI Site Map has the title of all the main pages. Think about what word or phrase might be in the title of the web page that has the information you are looking for.

 
== Standard Search ==
 
We do not have an optimized general search. The information in [[http://www.w3.org/WAI/search.php Searching the WAI Web Site]] might help some.

 
== Tell Others! ==
