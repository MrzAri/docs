{{Summary_Section|Assistive technology tools help people with physical limitations access web content.  To work effectively, these tools require that the information in the web site is contained in the expected format: words are given as text characters (not images), different types of content (e.g. headings, emphasized text) are distinguished with the correct markup tags (not simply by stylistic effects), and interactive components aren't dependent on particular methods of user input (such as mouse clicks).}}
