{{Summary_Section|The '''tactile'' media group is used to identify CSS properties and features that apply to a media type that is experienced by the user through touch.}}
{{CSS Media Group
|Description=Practical applications of CSS tactile media are currently restricted to Braille-based media ([[css/media queries/media types/braille|braille]] for dynamic terminals and [[css/media queries/media types/embossed|embossed]] for printed braille documents).  However, the concept could be expanded to include other touch-based media, such as 3D printed objects.
