## Summary

The visual media group is used to identify CSS properties and features that apply to any media type that has a visible layout and text.

The vast majority of defined CSS properties apply to visual media, which are defined by the fact that the content is appreciated primarily through sight. Visual media is contrasted against [tactile media](/css/media_queries/media_groups/tactile) (braille-based media experienced through touch) and [audio](/css/media_queries/media_groups/audio) or [speech media](/css/media_queries/media_groups/speech).
