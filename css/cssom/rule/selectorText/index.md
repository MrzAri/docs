<span data-meta="applies_to" data-type="key">Property of <span data-type="value">[css/cssom/rule](/css/cssom/rule)</span></span>

## Syntax

``` {.js}
var result = element.selectorText;
element.selectorText = value;
```

Selector text can contain either a simple selector (such as 'H1') or a contextual selector (such as 'P EM') that consists of several simple selectors. Compound selectors (such as 'B, STRONG') are stored as separate rules in the collection.
