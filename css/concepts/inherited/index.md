Many CSS properties ''inherit'' (or ''cascade'') their values from
their parent element. For example, a block '''div''' element may
specify one [[css/properties/font-size|'''font-size''']] value, which
one of its child '''p''' elements may override with another.  Applying
the built-in '''inherit''' keyword as a value for this '''p''' element
would then reapply the value inherited from the parent.
