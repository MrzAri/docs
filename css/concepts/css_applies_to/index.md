The ''applies to'' field indicates whether a CSS property only renders
in particular contexts or in conjunction with other properties. For
example, the [[css/properties/list-style-type|'''list-style-type''']]
property typically applies to '''li''' items within ordered ('''ol''')
or unordered ('''ul''') lists. The
[[css/properties/justify-content|'''justify-content''']] property only
applies to ''flex containers'' whose
[[css/properties/display|'''display''']] property is set to ''flex'''.
