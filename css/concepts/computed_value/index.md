A CSS property's ''computed value'' is the value that actually applies to the element after the CSS is fully interpreted. Many properties allow you to define measurements as percentages and other relative units, and the browser usually translates these to absolute units. (Computed values can be viewed in the browser's web inspector interface, and are available to scripts using the [[css/cssom/methods/getComputedStyle|'''getComputedStyle''']] API.
