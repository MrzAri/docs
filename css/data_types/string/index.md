{{Summary_Section|The <code>&lt;string></code> CSS data type represents character data surrounded with either single ('''&apos;''') or double ('''"''') quote characters.  Any unicode characters can be included in the string, but many need to be expressed with escape sequences.}}
{{Data_Type_Page
|Content=The CSS escape character is the backslash ('''\''').  There are two ways to create an escape sequence: 

* as a backslash followed by the special character (e.g., '''\"''' for a double quote or '''\\''' for a backslash);
* as a backslash followed by a hexadecimal number representing the unicode value (e.g.,  '''\22''' for a double quote, '''\263A''' for a smiley face or '''\a''' for a line break); either lowercase or uppercase letters may be used for the hexadecimal digits. 

Unicode characters may also be entered directly, if the file is saved with the correct encoding and a [[css/atrules/@charset| <code>@charset</code> rule]] is declared at the top of the stylesheet file (for embedded style blocks, an equivalent charset declaration must be made in the HTML/XML).

The following characters always need to be escaped:

* quotation marks of the same type used to delimit the string (but single quotes can be used unescaped in a double-quoted string and vice versa);
* the backslash character;
* line breaks (see below).

If you wish to break a long string of text across multiple lines in your source code, you can insert a '''\''' escape character immediately before the line break.  The escaped linebreak is '''not''' included in the resulting string.  To include a line break character in the final string value, you will also need to add a '''\a''' escape sequence.
