{{Summary_Section|The ''':focus''' pseudo-class applies while an element has the focus, i.e. accepts keyboard or mouse events, or other forms of input.}}
{{CSS_Selector
|Content=In an HTML document, an element must receive focus from the user in order to become active and perform its tasks. For example, users must set input focus on a link in order to follow it. Similarly, users must give a [[html/elements/textarea|textarea]] focus in order to enter text into it.

There are several ways to give focus to an element:
* Designate the element with a pointing device. Even elements that do not typically accept input, such as '''[[html/elements/div|div]]''' and '''[[html/elements/body|body]]''' elements, receive focus when clicked with the mouse.
* Navigate through the document with the TAB and Shift+TAB keys. The documentâ€™s author may define a tabbing order that specifies the order in which elements will receive focus with the [[html/attributes/tabindex|tabindex]] attribute.
* Select an element through a [[html/attributes/accessKey|'''keyboard shortcut''']].
