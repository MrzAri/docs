{{Notes_Section
|Usage=A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to selectors that specifies a special state of the element to be selected. For example :hover will apply a style when the user hovers over the element specified by the selector.

Pseudo-classes, together with pseudo-elements, let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document tree, but also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator (<code>:visited</code>, for example), the status of its content (like <code>:checked</code> on some form elements), or the position of the mouse (like <code>:hover</code> which lets you know if the mouse is over an element or not).
