|Content=The :hover pseudo-class applies while the user designates an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. Typically, a browser applies this pseudo-class when the mouse pointer hovers over a box generated by the element. 

Note that not all pointing devices let the user designating without activating an element (e.g. pen or touch-interactions)

|Description=The following example sets the hover style of an anchor. When the user hovers the mouse pointer over a link, the text appears in bold red, over a beige background.
|Code=a:hover { color:red; background-color:beige; font-weight:bolder; }

{{Notes_Section
|Usage=The ''':hover''' pseudo-class is often used with [[css/selectors/pseudo-classes/:active|''':active''']], [[css/selectors/pseudo-classes/:link|''':link''']], and [[css/selectors/pseudo-classes/:visited|''':visited''']]; which are the pseudo-classes that affect the other states of a link.

Indiscriminate use of the ''':hover''' pseudo-class can negatively impact page performance.
|Notes=The order of pseudo-classes is important. For example, the style rule for ''':hover''' must occur after any [[css/selectors/pseudo-classes/:link|''':link''']] rule or any [[css/selectors/pseudo-classes/:visited|''':visited''']] rule to prevent the pseudo-classes from hiding each other.

|Note=when the browser is in standards-compliant mode (strict [[html/elements/!DOCTYPE|!DOCTYPE]]), you can apply the ''':hover''' pseudo-class to any element, not only links. If the pseudo-class is not applied specifically to an element in the selector, such as the [[html/elements/a|'''a''']] tag, the [[css/selectors/Universal|Universal (*) Selector]] is assumed.
