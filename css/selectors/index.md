{{Summary_Section|The :in-range pseudo selector selects input elements when their value is within a specified range.}}
{{Basic Page}}
The :in-range CSS pseudo-class matches when an element has its value attribute inside the specified range limitations for this element. It allows the page to give a feedback that the value currently defined using the element is inside the range limits.

This pseudo-class only applies to elements that have a range limitations, such as input elements with min and max attributes. In absence of such a limitation, the element can neither be 'in-range' nor 'out-of-range'.

Use the :out-of-range selector to select all elements with a value that is outside a specified range.

Example


Note: This pseudo-class is not currently supported in Internet Explorer.
