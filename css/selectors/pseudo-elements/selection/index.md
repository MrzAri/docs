# ::selection

**Needs Summary**: This article does not have a summary. Summaries give a brief overview of the topic and are automatically included on some listing pages that link to this article.

 The **::selection** pseudo-element is the UI element fragments pseudo-element. It is used to select any part of the page that the user has highlighted, including text within an editable text field. This pseudo-element supports the [**color**](/css/properties/color) and [**background-color**](/css/properties/background-color) properties.

It was proposed as part of CSS3 Selectors, but was removed due to concerns of undefined behaviors (e.g. for nested elements).

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.
