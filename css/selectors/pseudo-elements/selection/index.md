{{CSS_Selector
|Content=The '''::selection''' pseudo-element is the UI element fragments pseudo-element. It is used to select any part of the page that the user has highlighted, including text within an editable text field. This pseudo-element supports the [[css/properties/color|'''color''']] and [[css/properties/background-color|'''background-color''']] properties.

It was proposed as part of CSS3 Selectors, but was removed due to concerns of undefined behaviors (e.g. for nested elements).
