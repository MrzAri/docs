## Summary

CSS properties are the key to altering the styling of HTML elements in your web documents.

API Name
:   Summary
[font-variant](/css/fonts/font-variant)
:   Selects a normal, or small-caps face from a font family. Also possible by using the font shorthand.
[-ms-flex-pack](/css/properties/-ms-flex-pack)
:   Gets or sets a value that specifies how excess space is distributed (along the axis defined by the [-ms-flex-direction](/w/index.php?title=-ms-flex-direction&action=edit&redlink=1) property) between child elements of the object.
[align-content](/css/properties/align-content)
:   Aligns a flex container's lines within the flex container when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how [justify-content](/css/properties/justify-content) aligns individual items within the main-axis.
[align-items](/css/properties/align-items)
:   Sets the default alignment in the cross axis for all of the flex container's items, including anonymous flex items, similarly to how [justify-content](/css/properties/justify-content) aligns items along the main axis.
[align-self](/css/properties/align-self)
:   Allows the default alignment to be overridden for individual flex items.
[alignment-adjust](/css/properties/alignment-adjust)
:   This property allows precise alignment of elements, such as graphics, that do not have a baseline-table or lack the desired baseline in their baseline-table. With the alignment-adjust property, the position of the baseline identified by the alignment-baseline can be explicitly determined. It also determines precisely the alignment point for each glyph within a textual element.
[alignment-baseline](/css/properties/alignment-baseline)
:
[all-space-treatment](/css/properties/all-space-treatment)
:   Specifies the treatment of all consecutive white space characters (with no exception for line feed characters).
[animation](/css/properties/animation)
:   Shorthand property to define a CSS animation, setting all parameters at once.
[animation-delay](/css/properties/animation-delay)
:   Defines a length of time to elapse before an animation starts, allowing an animation to begin execution some time after it is applied.
[animation-direction](/css/properties/animation-direction)
:   Defines whether an animation should run in reverse on some or all cycles.
[animation-duration](/css/properties/animation-duration)
:   Defines the length of time an animation takes to complete one cycle.
[animation-fill-mode](/css/properties/animation-fill-mode)
:   Defines what values are applied by the animation outside the time it is executing (before and after the animation).

    By default, an animation does not affect property values between the time it is applied (when the [animation-name](/css/properties/animation-name) property is set on an element) and the time it begins execution (determined by the [animation-delay](/css/properties/animation-delay) property). Also, by default an animation does not affect property values after the animation ends (determined by the [animation-duration](/css/properties/animation-duration) property). The [animation-fill-mode](/css/properties/animation-fill-mode) property can override this behavior.

[animation-iteration-count](/css/properties/animation-iteration-count)
:   Specifies how many times an animation cycle should play.
[animation-name](/css/properties/animation-name)
:   Defines the list of animations that apply to the element.
[animation-play-state](/css/properties/animation-play-state)
:   Defines whether an animation is running or paused.
[animation-timing-function](/css/properties/animation-timing-function)
:   Describes how the animation will progress over one cycle of its duration.
[appearance](/css/properties/appearance)
:   Allows changing the style of any element to platform-based interface elements or vice versa.
[backface-visibility](/css/properties/backface-visibility)
:   Determines whether or not the “back” side of a transformed element is visible when facing the viewer.
[background](/css/properties/background)
:   This background property is a shorthand property for setting the color, position, size, repeat, clip, origin, attachment, and image of the element.

    The background- properties provide fundamental styles to an element, such as color, image, and position. CSS3 adds more properties for handling backgrounds, including properties that improve the mobile web experience. Many CSS background properties can be set, at the same time, with this background property.

[background-attachment](/css/properties/background-attachment)
:   Defines if a background image scrolls with the content or stays fixed.
[background-blend-mode](/css/properties/background-blend-mode)
:   This property describes how the element's background images should blend with each other and the element's background color.

    The value is a list of blend modes that corresponds to each background image. Each element in the list will apply to the corresponding element of background-image. If a property doesn’t have enough comma-separated values to match the number of layers, the UA must calculate its used value by repeating the list of values until there are enough.

[background-clip](/css/properties/background-clip)
:   Specifies how an element’s background is clipped.
[background-color](/css/properties/background-color)
:   Sets a color to fill up the background of an element it is applied to and accepts any valid CSS color.
[background-composite](/css/properties/background-composite)
:
[background-image](/css/properties/background-image)
:   Applies one or more background images to an element. These can be any valid CSS image, including url() paths to image files or CSS gradients.
[background-origin](/css/properties/background-origin)
:   Specifies what the background-position property is relative to.
[background-position](/css/properties/background-position)
:   `background-position` allows you to set the placement of a `background-image` on the element it is applied to. `background-position` generally takes two values, which set the horizontal and vertical position of the background image inside the element.
[background-position-x](/css/properties/background-position-x)
:   Sets the horizontal position of a background image.
[background-position-y](/css/properties/background-position-y)
:   Sets vertical starting position of a background image.
[background-repeat](/css/properties/background-repeat)
:   Background-repeat defines if and how background images will be repeated after they have been sized and positioned
[background-size](/css/properties/background-size)
:   Specifies the size of the background images.
[baseline-shift](/css/properties/baseline-shift)
:   Obsolete - spec retired, not implemented.
[behavior](/css/properties/behavior)
:   Non standard. Sets or retrieves the location of the Dynamic HTML (DHTML) behavior.
[block-progression](/css/properties/block-progression)
:   Sets the block progression and layout orientation: deprecated in favor of the [writing-mode](/css/properties/writing-mode) property.
[border](/css/properties/border)
:   Shorthand property that defines the different properties of all four sides of an element's border in a single declaration. It can be used to set [border-width](/css/properties/border-width), [border-style](/css/properties/border-style) and [border-color](/css/properties/border-color), or a subset of these.
[border-bottom](/css/properties/border-bottom)
:   Shorthand property that defines the [**border-width**](/css/properties/border-width), [**border-style**](/css/properties/border-style) and [**border-color**](/css/properties/border-color) of an element's bottom border in a single declaration. Note that you can use the corresponding longhand properties to set specific individual properties of the bottom border — [**border-bottom-width**](/css/properties/border-bottom-width), [**border-bottom-style**](/css/properties/border-bottom-style) and [**border-bottom-color**](/css/properties/border-bottom-color).
[border-bottom-color](/css/properties/border-bottom-color)
:   Sets the color of the bottom border. This page explains the border-bottom-color value, but often you will find it more convenient to fix the border's bottom color as part of a shorthand set, either [border-bottom](/css/properties/border-bottom) or [border-color](/css/properties/border-color).

    [Colors](/css/data_types/color) can be defined several ways. For more information, see [Usage](/css/properties/border-bottom-color#Usage).

[border-bottom-left-radius](/css/properties/border-bottom-left-radius)
:   Defines the shape of the border of the bottom-left corner.
[border-bottom-right-radius](/css/properties/border-bottom-right-radius)
:   Defines the shape of the border of the bottom-right corner.
[border-bottom-style](/css/properties/border-bottom-style)
:   Sets the style of an element's bottom border. To set all four borders, use the shorthand property, [border-style](/css/properties/border-style). Otherwise, you can set the borders individually with [border-top-style](/css/properties/border-top-style), [border-right-style](/css/properties/border-right-style), [border-bottom-style](/css/properties/border-bottom-style), [border-left-style](/css/properties/border-left-style).
[border-bottom-width](/css/properties/border-bottom-width)
:   Sets the width of an element's bottom border. To set all four borders, use the [border-width](/css/properties/border-width) shorthand property which sets the values simultaneously for [border-top-width](/css/properties/border-top-width), [border-right-width](/css/properties/border-right-width), [border-bottom-width](/css/properties/border-bottom-width), and [border-left-width](/css/properties/border-left-width).
[border-collapse](/css/properties/border-collapse)
:   Border-collapse can be used for collapsing the borders between table cells
[border-color](/css/properties/border-color)
:   The CSS border-color property sets the color of an element's four borders. This property can have from one to four values, made up of the elementary properties:

    -   [border-top-color](/css/properties/border-top-color)
    -   [border-right-color](/css/properties/border-right-color)
    -   [border-bottom-color](/css/properties/border-bottom-color)
    -   [border-left-color](/css/properties/border-left-color)

    The default color is the currentColor of each of these values.

    If you provide one value, it sets the color for the element. Two values set the horizontal and vertical values, respectively. Providing three values sets the top, vertical, and bottom values, in that order. Four values set all for sides: top, right, bottom, and left, in that order.

[border-corner-shape](/css/properties/border-corner-shape)
:   Specifies different corner clipping effects, such as scoop (inner curves), bevel (straight cuts) or notch (cut-off rectangles). Works along with border-radius to specify the size of each corner effect.
[border-image](/css/properties/border-image)
:   Shorthand property that defines an image to be displayed and its positioning, instead of a solid color, for 'border' property. It can be used to set [**border-image-source**](/css/properties/border-image-source), [**border-image-slice**](/css/properties/border-image-slice), [**border-image-width**](/css/properties/border-image-width), [**border-image-outset**](/css/properties/border-image-outset) and [**border-image-repeat**](/css/properties/border-image-repeat), or a subset of these.
[border-image-outset](/css/properties/border-image-outset)
:   The `border-image-outset` property describes, by which amount the border image area extends beyond the border box.
[border-image-repeat](/css/properties/border-image-repeat)
:   The `border-image-repeat` CSS property defines how the middle part of a border image is handled to match the size of the border. It has a one-value syntax which describes the behavior for all sides, and a two-value syntax that sets a different value for the horizontal and vertical behavior.
[border-image-slice](/css/properties/border-image-slice)
:   Divides the image specified by border-image-source in nine regions: the four corners, the four edges and the middle. It does this by specifying 4 inward offsets.
[border-image-source](/css/properties/border-image-source)
:   The property `border-image-source` is used to set the image to be used instead of the border style. If this is set to `none` the `border-style` is used instead.
