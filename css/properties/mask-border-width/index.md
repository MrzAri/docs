{{Summary_Section|The mask image is drawn inside an area called the mask box image area. This is an area whose boundaries by default correspond to the mask box, see ‘mask-box-image-outset’. 

The four values of ‘mask-box-image-width’ specify offsets that are used to divide the mask box image area into nine parts. They represent inward distances from the the top, right, bottom, and left sides of the area, respectively. If the left width is missing, it is the same as the right; if the bottom is missing, it is the same as the top; if the right is missing, it is the same as the top.
