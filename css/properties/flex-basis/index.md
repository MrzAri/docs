|Description=The flex item's initial main size is determined by either the [[css/properties/width|width]] or [[css/properties/height|height]] property, whichever is in the main dimension, as determined by the [[css/properties/flex-flow|flex-direction]] property. Note that the value of the [[css/properties/width|width]] or [[css/properties/height|height]] property itself may be '''auto''', in which case the size is determined by the flex item's contents.
