{{Summary_Section|This property specifies inward offsets from the top, right, bottom, and left edges of the mask image, dividing it into nine regions: four corners, four edges and a middle. The middle image part is discarded (treated as fully transparent black) unless the ‘fill’ keyword is present. 

When four values are specified, they set the offsets on the top, right, bottom and left sides in that order. If the left is missing, it is the same as the right; if the bottom is missing, it is the same as the top; if the right is missing, it is the same as the top.
