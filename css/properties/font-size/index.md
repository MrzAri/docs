    A set of absolute size keywords based on the user's default font size (which is medium). Similar to presentational HTML's <font size="1"> through <font size="7"> where the user's default font size is <font size="3">.
larger, smaller
    Larger or smaller than the parent element's font size, by roughly the ratio used to separate the absolute size keywords above.
length
    A positive length. When the units are specified in em or ex,  the size is defined relative to the size of the font on the parent element of the element in question. For example, 0.5em is half the font size of the parent of the current element.
percentage
    A positive percentage of the parent element's font size.
