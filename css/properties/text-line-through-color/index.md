This property is obsolete and has been replaced by the [text-decoration-color](/css/properties/text-decoration-color) property.

Originally defined in an earlier draft of the [CSS3 Text Module specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-text-20030514/), the functionality controlled by this property is now defined in the [CSS Text Decoration Level 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-decor-3) module. Sites (and apps) relying on the earlier behavior should be updated accordingly.
