{{Basic Page}}
* Who is this course for? What will it and won't it teach?
* What is the web? Very briefly
* Why is the web such a good thing?
* Why should you learn how to make sites and applications for the web?
* What are standards, and conversely, what are web standards? Also outline accessibility somewhere in here
* Give very brief idea of what technologies we use to build the web
* Go over the fundamental tools of the trade.

In this course, you'll be writing a lot of code, and testing it out in web browsers. Before you start, you should at least have the following installed:

* The newest browsers you are able to install. If you don't have them already, grab them from the homepages of [http://www.google.com/chrome Chrome], [http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ Firefox], and [http://www.opera.com Opera]. If you are on Windows please make sure [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/internet-explorer/products/ie/home Internet Explorer] is up-to-date; on Mac OS please make sure [http://www.apple.com/safari/ Safari] is up-to-date.
* A decent text editor. Reasonable free options are [http://foicica.com/textadept/ TextAdept], [http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ Notepad++], [http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-for-web Visual Studio Express] for Windows, [http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/ Text Wrangler] for Mac, and [http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/index.html Bluefish] for Linux.

** Web Browser
** Code editor
** FTP program

* How does the web work, in simple terms, and how do your tools slot into that?
