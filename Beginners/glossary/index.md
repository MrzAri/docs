<dl>
<dt>
Client:</dt>
<dd> Any computing device, such as your laptop or mobile phone, that can be used to connect to and draw content from the web. Your device uses an application (usually a web browser) to request a web site/other data from a server; the server then sends back a response, which includes all the information needed for your application to display the web site or other data you requested.</dd>
<dt>
 DNS (Domain Name Server):</dt>
<dd> This is essentially an address book for the Web that links common names to the numerical addresses at which all Web sites are stored. All Web sites are actually located at numerical addresses of the form ###.###.###.### called IP addresses. Domain Name Servers associate these addresses with domain names, so they are easier to handle for humans. So for example, the IP address of google.co.uk is 173.194.66.94 — try typing it in and you'll see we're right — but google.co.uk is far easier to remember!</dd>
<dt>
Networking Protocols:</dt>
<dd> Agreed upon methods by which computers communicate with each other on a network, allowing the many different types of computers on the Web to talk to each other. The term HTTP, for instance, means Hyper Text Transfer Protocol and tells your browser how to interface with the network to access information stored on the Web.</dd>
<dt>
Transmission Protocols:</dt>
<dd> The various agreed upon methods for transporting data around the Web, the most common being FTP, File Transfer Protocol.</dd>
<dt>Web Browser:</dt>
<dd> A program installed on a Client allowing it to access and display web sites, thereby allowing you to interact with the Web.</dd>
<dt>Web servers:</dt>
<dd> The computers on which web sites are stored, ready for delivery to those who want to look at them.</dd>
<dt>
Web Technologies:</dt>
<dd> these are the different types of code that web developers use to create web sites, which define things such as the text you want to show on the web page, the styles that text should have, etc. The web browser receives such code from a server and assembles it into a complete web page.
