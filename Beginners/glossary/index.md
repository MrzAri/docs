{{Basic Page}}
<dl>
<dt>API (Application Program Interface):</dt>
<dd>A set of commands, functions, and protocols which can be used to build websites. APIs are predefined functions that web site authors can call to perform certain tasks instead of writing code from scratch to perform them.</dd>
<dt>Attribute:</dt>
<dd>An instruction or definition or additional defined characteristic of an Element, such as HREF or Title, the parts that show up to the left of equal signs after the Element itself in the opening tag, thus &#60;tag HREF=&#8220;&#8220; Title=&#8220;the HREF and Title to the left are attributes&#8220;&#62;. </dd>
<dt>Browser:</dt>
<dd>A program installed on a Client allowing it to access and display web sites, thereby allowing you to interact with the Web.</dd>
<dt>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</dt>
<dd>A language for specifying how documents are presented to users. A document is a collection of information that is structured using a markup language.</dd>
<dt>Client:</dt>
<dd>Any computing device, such as your laptop or mobile phone, that can be used to connect to and draw content from the web. Your device uses an application (usually a web browser) to request a web site/other data from a server; the server then sends back a response, which includes all the information needed for your application to display the web site or other data you requested.</dd>
<dt>Cursive: </dt>
<dd>Used to describe fonts that have a decorative, often handwritten-looking style</dd>
<dt>DNS (Domain Name Server):</dt>
<dd> This is essentially an address book for the Web that links common names to the numerical addresses at which all Web sites are stored. All Web sites are actually located at numerical addresses of the form ###.###.###.### called IP addresses. Domain Name Servers associate these addresses with domain names, so they are easier to handle for humans. So for example, the IP address of google.co.uk is 173.194.66.94 — try typing it in and you'll see we're right — but google.co.uk is far easier to remember!</dd>
<dt>Element:</dt>
<dd>Any basic part or definition, the first part between the opening &#60;brackets&#62;.</dd>
<dt>Entity:</dt>
<dd>A special character, such as &#182; or &#188;, best displayed by use of an escape code.</dd>
<dt>Escape Code:</dt>
<dd>A means for displaying an Entity, such as &#60; without it having coding effect, typically by use of a string that begins &#.</dd>
<dt>Fantasy: </dt>
<dd>Used to describe fonts that have a bold, often ornamental or quirky style, which are meant to be used for headings, not body copy</dd>
<dt>Font Stack:</dt>
<dd>A sequential listing of preferred fonts to display on a web page allowing a developer to specify alternatives in the case that a desired font is not available to a Client.</dd>
<dt>FTP (File Transfer Protocol):</dt>
<dd>A protocol that defines the manner in which files can be loaded to or from Servers such that there is a standard method that can be used by any of the many disparate devices that can connect to the Web.</dd>
<dt>Hexadecimal:</dt>
<dd>A base 16 counting system where the numbers 10 through 16 are represented by the letters A through F.</dd>
<dt>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language):</dt>
<dd>A language to describe the contents of web documents. It uses a special syntax containing markers (called “elements”) which are wrapped around the text within the document to indicate how user agents (eg. web browsers) should interpret that portion of the document.</dd>
<dt>Monospaced: </dt>
<dd>Used to describe fonts in which every glyph takes up the same space, like in computer code</dd>
<dt>Networking Protocols:</dt>
<dd> Agreed upon methods by which computers communicate with each other on a network, allowing the many different types of computers on the Web to talk to each other. The term HTTP, for instance, means Hyper Text Transfer Protocol and tells your browser how to interface with the network to access information stored on the Web.</dd>
<dt>RGB</dt>
<dd>Literally, red, green and blue.  For our purposes a hexadecimal notation that provides levels for each of the colors red green and blue.</dd>
<dt><Sans-serif:/dt>
<dd>Sans meaning without in french, this describes fonts without serifs.</dd>
<dt>Serif</dt>
<dd>Term used to describe fonts with small lines extending from the edges of letters and symbols</dd>
<dt>Server:</dt>
<dd>A computer on which web sites are stored, ready for delivery to those who want to look at them.</dd>
<dt>Style Sheeet:</dt>
<dd>A set of instructions for how the content of a markup file should be displayed.</dd>
<dt>SVG:</dt>
<dd>A markup language for graphics.</dd>
<dt>Transmission Protocols:</dt>
<dd>The various agreed upon methods for transporting data around the Web.</dd>
<dt>User Agent:</dt>
<dd>Any software that is used to access web pages on behalf of users. There is an important distinction to be made here—all types of desktop browser software (Internet Explorer, Opera, Firefox, Safari, Chrome etc.) and alternative browsers for other devices (such as the Wii Internet channel, and mobile phone browsers such as Opera Mini and WebKit on the iPhone) are user agents, but not all user agents are browser software. The automated programs that Google and Yahoo! use to index the web to use in their search engines are also user agents, but no human being is controlling them directly.</dd>
<dt>Web Browser:</dt>
<dd> See Browser </dd>
<dt>Web-safe fonts</dt>
<dd>The 11 or so fonts that are installed across almost all systems, termed web safe fonts because they are safe for use in your pages.  These are: Verdana, Arial, Trebuchet MS (sans-serif); Times New Roman, Georgia (serif); Andale Mono, Courier New (monospaced); Comic Sans (cursive); Impact (fantasy).</dd>
<dt>Web Servers:</dt>
<dd>See Server</dd>
<dt>Web Technologies:</dt>
<dd> these are the different types of code that web developers use to create web sites, which define things such as the text you want to show on the web page, the styles that text should have, etc. The web browser receives such code from a server and assembles it into a complete web page.
</dd>
<dt>XML:</dt>
<dd>A markup language for structured documents in general.</dd>
<dt>XUL:</dt>
<dd>A markup language for user interfaces in Mozilla.</dd>
