==Before you start==

In this course, you'll be writing a lot of code, and testing it out in web browsers. Before you start, you should at least have the following installed:

* The newest browsers you are able to install. If you don't have them already, grab them from the homepages of [http://www.google.com/chrome Chrome], [http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ Firefox], [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/internet-explorer/products/ie/home Internet Explorer], [http://www.opera.com Opera], and [http://www.apple.com/safari/ Safari].
* A decent text editor. Reasonable free options are [http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ Notepad++] for Windows, [http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/ Text Wrangler] for Mac, and [http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/index.html Bluefish] for Linux.
