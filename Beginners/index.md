==Before you start==

In this section, you will be writing a lot of code, and testing it out in web browsers. Before you start, you should at least have the following installed:

* The newest browsers you are able to install. — You do not need all of them in the same time, a recent one will do!
** All Platforms
***[https://www.google.com/chrome Google Chrome]
***[http://www.mozilla.org/firefox Mozilla Firefox]
***[http://www.opera.com Opera]
** Windows
***[http://microsoft.com/ie Microsoft Internet Explorer]
** Mac OS
***[http://www.apple.com/safari/ Apple Safari].

* ''optionnal'', a bleeding edge version of the browser — useful if you want to test very recent techniques
** [http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html Google Chrome Canary]
** [http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/#aurora Mozilla Firefox Aurora]
** [http://www.opera.com/computer/next Opera Next]
** A [https://modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads modern.ie VM] with a pre-release version of Microsoft Internet Explorer

* A text editor, there are plenty of free and open source for you to choose from. — try to learn by avoiding auto-completion and type everything, you will feel the benefits later!
** All Platforms
<!--
DO NOT:
Add Sublime Text to this list. It is *NOT* free.
The point of the editors listed are to be free and
simple to use editors that someone with no prior
experience can pick up and start writing with.

Also, please do not add terminal programs like vim
and emacs to this list. Yes they are great, but not
entry level editors.

Thank you for your co operation.

==More on Browser testing==

To learn how web browsers react, it is quite useful to have automated tools. But modern browsers are now doing a very good job at behaving the same. Unless you are digging right away with technologies that are still in early adoption, you do not need browser testing tools.

There are a few services to help you test on multiple browsers. While it is very helpful, if you have more than one web browser available its more enough to start learning.

If you want to test various versions of old web browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, you can use a Virtual Machine ("VM"). In fact, Microsoft has created a set of VMs at [http://modern.ie modern.ie] from which you can load and test your sites on. Those VMs aren’t made to use as a main workspace, but merely to boot and try your pages. You can install older version of web browsers on them too.

Note that the  [http://modern.ie modern.ie VMs] will ask you to delete the VM after 30 days. A trick that you can do is to keep a copy of the downloaded archive and extract it again when appropriate.

As for automated browser testing, its is only useful if you work on bigger projects and goes beyond the scope of this section. 

There are  a few automated browser testing services. They do not require you to install anything and they give you screenshots of the pages you are providing them on various browser versions, including the mobile ones.  

Here is a list of browser testing:

* [http://browsershots.org/ Browsershots] (Screenshots only)
* [http://crossbrowsertesting.com/ CrossBrowserTesting] (commercial)
* [https://saucelabs.com/ SauceLabs] (free and commercial plans).
