{{Basic Page}}
Note to authors: this part provides a very quick "hands dirty" session on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We're not giving all the information - we are just trying to get the reader comfortable and give him/her a sense of achievement to begin with, before they get bored by all the details ;-)

* Explain what HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are, show how to create some really trivially simple examples
* Show what a simple site structure might look like
* Go through simple HTML anatomy
* Show what an HTML page looks like, explain its purpose. Show head, body, title, and a few other things
* Add some really simple bits to it. headings and paragraphs, bullet points, an image maybe
* explain simple common gotchas - quote problems, incorrect paths, bad nesting, missing out attributes
* Next, go through simple CSS anatomy
* Show how simple CSS selectors work
* Go through how to apply CSS to HTML - 3 ways
* explain simple CSS gotchas - bad pathing, missing semi colons, missing attributes, incorrect adding of classes to elements (I've seen people try to use <class="heading">content</class>) 
* next, show simple javascript anatomy and explain how it works
* show some really simple JS use
* explain simple JS gotchas, and explain that it needs quite a bit more understanding than HTML or CSS. But it has more power.
* Take the user through the steps towards getting web space (use a free service, such as http://www.biz.nf/), and get them to set up their FTP, and upload their simple files.
* Show them how they can now view their files on another computer.
