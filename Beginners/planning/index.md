{{Summary_Section|Now you've got some familiarity with basic web code, let's take a step back, introducing an example project for you to work on and taking the necessary steps to plan it. Let's build a recipe site!}}
{{Basic Page}}
* First things first - what do we want the project to do, at a high level
* Project scope - What low level items does the site need?
* Information architecture - how should we group these items, and where should they go?
* Designing a look for the page structures - look at photoshopping, versus designing in the browser 
* Site structure - create folders for holding CSS, JS, and images.
