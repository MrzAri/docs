|Editorial notes=There are notes to describe what this section should cover, but no content.

Original page contents were notes:
* First things first - what do we want the project to do, at a high level
* Project scope - What low level items does the site need?
* Information architecture - how should we group these items, and where should they go?
* Designing a look for the page structures - look at photoshopping, versus designing in the browser 
* Site structure - create folders for holding CSS, JS, and images.
