===Remarks===
Protocol negotiation is part of the '''WebSocket''' connection handshake. The protocol value is not set until the connection is established. If the client specifies one or more protocols, the server returns one or none of the protocols during the protocol negotiation in the handshake. After the connection is established, then the protocol value is either empty or set to the protocol that was accepted.
