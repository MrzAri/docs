# ondownloading

## Summary

The user agent has found an update and is fetching it, or is downloading the resources listed by the manifest for the first time.

<span data-meta="applies_to" data-type="key">Property of <span data-type="value">[apis/appcache/ApplicationCache](/apis/appcache/ApplicationCache)</span></span>

## Syntax

``` {.js}
var result = window.applicationCache.ondownloading;
window.applicationCache.ondownloading = value;
```

## Return Value

<span data-meta="return" data-type="key">Returns an object of type <span data-type="value">null</span></span>

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.

## Notes

If more than one event is triggered and the **downloading** event is included, the next events may include **progress**, **error**, **cached**, or **updateready**. Alternatively, you could use an anonymous delegate function such as

    object.ondownloading = function (e) { â€¦ }

where e is the cached event.
