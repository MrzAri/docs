|Notes====Remarks===
This event can be generated by the following errors:
*The manifest referred to  a 404 or 410 page, preventing the page from being loaded.
*A page referenced in the manifest failed to download properly.
*A fatal error occurred while downloading the resources listed in the manifest.
*The manifest was changed while the update was being processed.

If there is more than one event, the '''error''' event will be the last one in the sequence.
Alternatively, you could use an anonymous delegate function such as
 <code>object.onerror {{=}} function (e) { â€¦ }</code>
where e is the cached event.
