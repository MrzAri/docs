# onerror

## Summary

Indicates an error has occurred.

<span data-meta="applies_to" data-type="key">Property of <span data-type="value">[apis/appcache/ApplicationCache](/apis/appcache/ApplicationCache)</span></span>

## Syntax

``` {.js}
var result = ApplicationCache.onerror;
ApplicationCache.onerror = value;
```

## Return Value

<span data-meta="return" data-type="key">Returns an object of type <span data-type="value">null</span></span>

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.

## Notes

This event can be generated by the following errors:

-   The manifest referred to a 404 or 410 page, preventing the page from being loaded.
-   A page referenced in the manifest failed to download properly.
-   A fatal error occurred while downloading the resources listed in the manifest.
-   The manifest was changed while the update was being processed.

If there is more than one event, the **error** event will be the last one in the sequence. Alternatively, you could use an anonymous delegate function such as

    object.onerror = function (e) { â€¦ }

where e is the cached event.
