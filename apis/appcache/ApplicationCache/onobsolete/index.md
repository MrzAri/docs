{{Notes_Section
|Notes=If the manifest file can't be found, the cache is considered to be deleted.
If there is more than one event, the '''obsolete''' event will be the last one in the sequence.
Alternatively, you could use an anonymous delegate function such as
 <code>object.onobsolete {{=}} function (e) { â€¦ }</code>
where e is the cached event.
