{{Summary_Section|Workers (also commonly referred to as Web Workers) are scripts that run in the background independently of any user interface scripts. This allows for long-running scripts that are not interrupted by scripts that respond to clicks or other user interactions, and allows long tasks to be executed without yielding to keep the page responsive.}}
