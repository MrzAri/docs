# Storage

## Summary

The Storage APIs provide developers with JavaScript objects for storing temporary and permanent data on the client's device. These features range from simple key/value storage to a robust sandboxed filesystem.

## Usage

     These APIs allow web apps to function offline. They are also a performance booster by storing large amounts of data locally instead of waiting for it to download. Lastly, they provide an easier programming model, with no server infrastructure required.
