# getFrames

## Summary

Returns the keyframes that make up this effect as a sequence of ComputedKeyframe objects.

*Method of [apis/web\_animations/KeyframeEffect](/apis/web_animations/KeyframeEffect)*

## Syntax

``` {.js}
var  = .getFrames();
```

## Return Value

Returns an object of type Object.

Returns a sequence of ComputedKeyFrame objects.

The value returned differs from the frames parameter passed into setFrames or the constructor for this interface in the following ways:

The normalization defined in ยง5.17.3 Normalizing a sequence of keyframes is applied to frames which may result in some frames being removed or re-ordered and some properties being removed. This normalization will also cause a single Keyframe object to be replaced with a sequence. The result of computing the keyframe offset of each keyframe as defined in ยง4.3.1 Spacing keyframes is stored in the computedOffset member of each frame.

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.
