|Return_value_description=Returns a sequence of ComputedKeyFrame objects.

The value returned differs from the frames parameter passed into setFrames or the constructor for this interface in the following ways:

The normalization defined in ยง5.17.3 Normalizing a sequence of keyframes is applied to frames which may result in some frames being removed or re-ordered and some properties being removed. This normalization will also cause a single Keyframe object to be replaced with a sequence.
The result of computing the keyframe offset of each keyframe as defined in ยง4.3.1 Spacing keyframes is stored in the computedOffset member of each frame.
