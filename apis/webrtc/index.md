|Usage=The RTC in WebRTC stands for Real-Time Communications, technology that enables audio/video streaming and data sharing between browser clients (peers). As a set of standards, WebRTC provides any browser with the ability to share application data and perform teleconferencing peer to peer, without the need to install plug-ins or third-party software. 

WebRTC components are accessed with JavaScript APIs. Currently in development are the Network Stream API, which represents an audio or video data stream, and the PeerConnection API, which allows two or more users to communicate browser-to-browser. Also under development is a DataChannel API that enables communication of other types of data for real-time gaming, text chat, file transfer, and so forth.
