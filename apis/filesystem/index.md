{{Summary_Section|The File System API simulates a local file system that web apps can navigate around. You can develop apps that can read, write, and create files and directories in a virtual, sandboxed file system. The asynchronous API methods return without blocking the calling thread. The asynchronous API doesn't give you data by returning values; instead, you have to pass a callback function. The synchronous API is intended to be used with WebWorkers.}}
