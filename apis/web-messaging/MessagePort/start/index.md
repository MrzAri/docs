# start

## Summary

Begins dispatching messages received on the port. See Notes.

*Method of [apis/web-messaging/MessagePort](/apis/web-messaging/MessagePort)*

## Syntax

``` {.js}
 MessagePort.start();
```

## Return Value

No return value

## Examples

This example creates a new message channel and uses one of the ports to send a message, which will be received by the other port, and then explicitly starts sending the message.

``` {.js}
var msgChannel = new MessageChannel();
msgChannel.port1.postMessage('Hello world');
msgChannel.port1.start();
```

## Notes

The **start** method is called implicitly by when an event handler function is assigned to the **onmessage** property. In Internet ExplorerÂ 10, the start method is also called implicitly when a message event is registered using the **addEventListener** method.
