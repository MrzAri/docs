=APIs=

==Summary==

APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are standard JavaScript objects that perform a variety of tasks. They encapsulate objects, methods, properties, and events that you can use to build applications that will work across different browsers.

== Background ==

APIs came into popularity on the Web a number of years ago, when open standards creators and web property developers realised it was a really good idea to make their data, services and technologies easily query-able and reusable via simple interfaces consisting of custom JavaScript objects. These days you'll find many examples of APIs available and in use all over the Web, for example:

* Web sites/applications as diverse as [https://dev.twitter.com/docs Twitter], [http://www.flickr.com/services/developer/ Flickr], [https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html Amazon], [http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/overview.html YouTube], [http://www.dropbox.com/developers Drop Box] and [http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform The Guardian].
* JavaScript libraries such as [http://modernizr.com/ Modernizr], [http://jquery.com/ jQuery] and [http://raphaeljs.com/ RaphaÃ«l].

Many libraries include API functionality, so you don't have to use the raw API. For APIs like [[apis/xhr|XHR]] and [[apis/websocket|Web Socket]], you would use the API through a library like jQuery rather than spin up your own HTTP request or build in your own socket layer. That said, though, these APIs are here for your reference.

Note: If you are completely new to web development, you may want to review [[beginners|Web development for beginners]].

==Contributing to the API documentation==

See the [[WPD:Proposals/api_docs|API Project page]] for a description of the work being performed to develop the API reference. See [[WPD:Creating_API_pages|Creating API pages]] to learn how to document an API.

==Contributing to the HTML technology==

To contribute to the development of APIs and provide feedback, you need to know where the specification and/or source code is kept. For example, you can find out how to comment on the HTML5 APIs by consulting the [http://www.w3.org/html/ W3C HTML home page], or suggest fixes to Modernizr via the [https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr Modernizr Github repo].
