=APIs=

==Summary==

APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, is a widespread and popular concept across most aspects of software development, referring to protocols that facilitate communication between software components. In the particular context of the Web, APIs generally refer to custom JavaScript objects we can use to extract data and/or make use of services from 3rd party sources, such as web applications, JavaScript libraries, or even web standards features.

== Background ==

APIs can into popularity on the Web a number of years ago, when open standards creators and web property developers realised it was a really good idea to make their data, services and technologies easily query-able and reusable via simple interfaces consisting of custom JavaScript objects. These days you'll find many examples of APIs available and in use all over the Web, for example:

* Web sites/applications as diverse as [[https://dev.twitter.com/docs|Twitter]], [[http://www.flickr.com/services/developer/|Flickr]], [[https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html|Amazon]], [[http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/overview.html|YouTube]], [[http://www.dropbox.com/developers|Drop Box]] and [[http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform|The Guardian]].
* JavaScript libraries such as [[http://modernizr.com/|Modernizr]], [[http://jquery.com/|jQuery]] and [[http://raphaeljs.com/|RaphaÃ«l]].
* HTML5 APIs such as the [[http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/embedded-content-0.html#media-elements|Media API]], [[http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/editing.html#dnd|Drag 'n' Drop API]], [[http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/browsers.html#offline|Offline web applications API]] and [[http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/browsers.html#history|History API]].

These allow us to do wonderful things such as reuse media content from 3rd party sources, write feature detection detection tests really easy, write effective cross browser SVG and events, and control HTML5 video.

==Contributing to the HTML technology==

To contribute to the development of APIs and provide feedback, you need to know where the specification and/or source code is kept. For example, you can find out how to comment on the HTML5 APIs by consulting the [http://www.w3.org/html/ W3C HTML home page], or suggest fixes to Modernizr via the [[https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr|Modernizr Github repo]].
