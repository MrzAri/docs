{{Glossary_Item
|Term=recommendation
|Definition=The World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) official title for what is often referred to as a "Web standard." Typically capitalized as Recommendation. Because the W3C does not certify anyone, because it has no bylaws or procedures to penalize members for violating Recommendations in their implementations, and because the practices set forth in W3C literature do not carry the force of law, the W3C only applies the term "standard" to other organizations' work, as appropriate.
