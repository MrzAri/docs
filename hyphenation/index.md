# hyphenation

## hyphenation

The practice of separating words at syllable boundaries with a hyphen character (-) in order to make them fit better on a line and avoid unnecessary trailing whitespace. Modern editing software has refined the text justification process, making hyphenation largely superfluous. Also called syllabication.
